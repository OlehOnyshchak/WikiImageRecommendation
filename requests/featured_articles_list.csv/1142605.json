"{\"title\": \"2005 Atlantic hurricane season\", \"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_Atlantic_hurricane_season\", \"text\": \"The 2005 Atlantic hurricane season was the most active Atlantic hurricane season in recorded history, shattering numerous records. The impact of the season was widespread and catastrophic. Its storms caused an estimated total of 3,960\\u00a0deaths and approximately $180.7\\u00a0billion in damage, making it the second costliest season on record, surpassed only by the 2017 season.\\n\\nOf the storms that made landfall, five of the season's seven major hurricanes\\u2014Dennis, Emily, Katrina, Rita, and Wilma\\u2014were responsible for the majority of the destruction. Stan was the most destructive storm that was not a major hurricane. The Mexican states of Quintana Roo and Yucat\\u00e1n and the U.S. states of Florida and Louisiana were each struck twice by major hurricanes; Cuba, the Bahamas, Haiti, Mississippi, Texas, Alabama, and Tamaulipas were each struck once and brushed by at least one more.\\n\\nThe most devastating effects of the season were felt on the United States' Gulf Coast, where a  storm surge from Hurricane Katrina caused severe flooding that destroyed most structures on the Mississippi coastline; subsequent levee failures in New Orleans, Louisiana caused by the storm crippled the city. Furthermore, Hurricane Stan combined with an extratropical system to cause deadly mudslides across Central America, with Guatemala being hardest-hit.\\n\\nThe 2005 season was the first to observe more tropical storms and cyclones in the Atlantic than in the West Pacific; on average, the latter experiences 26 tropical storms per year while the Atlantic only averages 12. This event was repeated in the 2010 season; however, the 2010 typhoon season broke the record for the fewest storms observed in a single year, while the 2005 typhoon season featured near-average activity.\\n\\nThe season officially began on June\\u00a01, 2005, and lasted until November\\u00a030, although it effectively persisted into January\\u00a02006 due to continued storm activity. A record twenty-eight tropical and subtropical storms formed, of which a record fifteen became hurricanes. Of these, a record-tying seven strengthened into major hurricanes, a record-tying five became Category\\u00a04 hurricanes and a record four reached Category\\u00a05 strength, the highest categorization for hurricanes on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Among these Category\\u00a05 storms were hurricanes Katrina and Wilma, respectively the costliest and the most intense (by lowest barometric pressure) Atlantic hurricanes on record. The 2005 season was also notable because the annual pre-designated list of storm names was used up and six Greek letter names had to be used.\\n\\nSeasonal forecasts\\n+Predictions of tropical activity in the 2005 seasonSourceDateTropicalstormsHurricanesMajorhurricanesCSUAverage (1950\\u20132000)9.65.92.3NOAAAverage1162CSUDecember 3, 20041163CSUApril 1, 20051373NOAAMay 16, 200512\\u2013157\\u201393\\u20135CSUMay 31, 20051584NOAAAugust 2, 200518\\u2013219\\u2013115\\u20137CSUAugust 5, 200520106Actual activity28157\\nForecasts of hurricane activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane expert William M. Gray and his associates at Colorado State University (CSU), and separately by forecasters with the U.S. Government's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Prior to and during the 2005 season, Gray issued four forecasts, each time increasing the predicted level of activity. The NOAA issued two forecasts, one shortly before the season and one two months into the season, drastically increasing the predicted level of activity in the second release. Nonetheless, all forecasts fell far short of the actual activity of the season.\\n\\nPreseason forecasts\\nOn December 3, 2004, Gray's team issued its first extended-range forecast for the 2005 season, predicting a slightly above-average season. Additionally, the team predicted a greatly increased chance of a major hurricane striking the East Coast of the United States and the Florida peninsula. Though the forecast predicted above-average activity, the level predicted was significantly less than the 2004 season. On April 1, 2005, after confirming that El Ni\\u00f1o conditions would not develop, Gray and his team revised the December forecast upward, expecting thirteen tropical storms instead of eleven and seven hurricanes instead of six. In addition, the chance of a storm impacting the United States was raised slightly.\\nOn May 16, 2005, 16\\u00a0days before the season began, NOAA issued its outlook for the 2005 season, forecasting a 70% chance of above-normal activity. The accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) value for the season was predicted to be 120\\u2013190% of the median ACE of 87.5 \\u00d7 104 kt2. Shortly thereafter, on May 31, the day before the season officially began, Gray's team revised its April forecast upwards to 15 named storms, 8 hurricanes, and 4 major hurricanes.\\n\\nMidseason outlook\\nOn August 2, after an extraordinarily active early season, the NOAA released an updated outlook on the remainder of the season, significantly raising the expected level of activity to numbers about double those of a normal season. The ACE value was now forecast to be 180 to 270% of the median. The NOAA also noted a higher than normal confidence in the forecast of above-normal activity. On August 5, 2005, Gray and his associates followed suit and issued their updated forecast; it was consistent with NOAA's update. Although neither the NOAA nor Gray had ever forecast such high levels of activity, even the midseason outlooks fell far short of the actual level of activity. The actual ACE would prove to be 248 \\u00d7 104 kt2\\u00a0\\u2014 277% of the median.\\n\\nSystems\\n\\nJune and July\\n\\nthumb|right|Hurricane Dennis making landfall on the Gulf Coast\\nOn June 8, nearly two months earlier than when the 2004 season started, Tropical Storm Arlene formed in the western Caribbean, crossing Cuba before making landfall on the Florida Panhandle on June 11. Arlene caused only moderate damage, although one swimmer was caught in a riptide and drowned in Miami Beach, Florida.\\n\\nTropical Storm Bret formed in the Bay of Campeche on June 28 and made landfall in Veracruz the next morning. The storm damaged hundreds of homes and caused flooding which killed two people.\\n\\nHurricane Cindy formed in the Gulf of Mexico on July 4. Originally thought to be a tropical storm, Cindy made landfall in Louisiana on July 5 as a minimal hurricane, dropping up to 5\\u00a0in (130\\u00a0mm) of rain, spawning several tornadoes, flooding some coastal areas including Coden, Alabama, and killing three people. Cindy was upgraded to a hurricane in the post-storm analysis.\\n\\nthumb|left|Satellite photo of Hurricane Emily near peak intensity\\n\\nOn July 5, Hurricane Dennis formed in the eastern Caribbean; it crossed Grenada before intensifying into a Category\\u00a04 hurricane, the strongest ever recorded in July with a pressure of 930 mbar (hPa). Dennis struck Cuba at full force, then made a final landfall on the Florida Panhandle. The hurricane killed 89\\u00a0people (mostly in Haiti) and caused $3.98\\u00a0billion (2005 USD) in damage in Cuba and the United States.\\n\\nSoon thereafter, Hurricane Emily formed in the Atlantic on July 11. It entered the Caribbean Sea and quickly intensified to a Category\\u00a04 storm, breaking Dennis's record for July intensity when its pressure reached 929\\u00a0mbar (hPa). Emily then briefly reached Category\\u00a05 intensity\\u2014the earliest such storm ever recorded in the Atlantic. Emily crossed the Yucat\\u00e1n Peninsula at Category\\u00a04 strength before hitting Tamaulipas at Category\\u00a03 strength. Emily killed at least 14\\u00a0people over the course of its path. An estimated $400\\u00a0million (2005 USD; $ \\u00a0USD) in damage was reported.\\n\\nTropical Storm Franklin formed off the Bahamas on July 18. The storm moved northeast and became extratropical off the coast of Atlantic Canada without ever having threatened land.\\n\\nTropical Storm Gert followed soon after on July 24. Gert struck Veracruz near where Emily had hit a few days before; roughly 1,000\\u00a0people were evacuated for fear of flooding, but no damage or deaths were reported.\\n\\nAugust\\nLike July, August also got off to a fast start: Tropical Storm Harvey formed southwest of Bermuda on August 3. Harvey dropped some rain on Bermuda as it moved to the northeast; it became extratropical on August 8 in the open Atlantic Ocean.\\n\\nThe tropical depression that would become Hurricane Irene formed west of the Cape Verde Islands on August 4. The system moved west and north and did not reach hurricane strength until August 14, at which point it became the second Cape Verde-type hurricane of the season. Irene turned northeast and briefly reached Category 2 status before weakening and becoming extratropical on August 18. It never posed a threat to land.\\nthumb|right|Eye of Hurricane Katrina as seen from a NOAA Hurricane Hunter P-3 aircraft\\n\\nTropical Depression Ten formed east of the Lesser Antilles on August 13. The system dissipated the next day. Its remnants soon merged with another system and eventually contributed to the formation of Hurricane Katrina.\\n\\nTropical Storm Jose followed, forming in the Bay of Campeche on August 22. It strengthened rapidly but quickly reached the coast and made landfall in the Mexican state of Veracruz on August 23, preventing further strengthening. Jose forced 25,000\\u00a0people to evacuate their homes in Veracruz and killed six people in the state of Oaxaca; two more were reported missing. In all, damage in Mexico amounted to $45\\u00a0million (2005\\u00a0USD; $ \\u00a0USD).\\nthumb|left|In Katrina's Wake \\u2013 short film about Hurricane Katrina by NASA\\nHurricane Katrina formed in mid-August over the Bahamas. It became a tropical storm on August 24 and reached hurricane intensity before making landfall in south Florida as a minimal hurricane. A few hours later, the storm entered the Gulf of Mexico and intensified rapidly into a Category 5 hurricane while crossing the Loop Current on August 28. Katrina made landfall shortly after 06:00 CST on August 29 near the mouth of the Mississippi River as an extremely large Category\\u00a03 hurricane. Category\\u00a05-level storm surges (as the storm had weakened only in the previous several hours) caused catastrophic damage along the coastlines of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Within hours, levees separating Lake Pontchartrain from New Orleans, Louisiana were breached by the surge, ultimately flooding about 80% of the city. Wind damage was reported well inland, impeding relief efforts. Katrina is estimated to be responsible for at least $125\\u00a0billion (2005\\u00a0USD) in damage, breaking Hurricane Andrew's record in 1992 and making it the costliest natural disaster in U.S. history until Harvey tied it in 2017. It was the deadliest U.S. hurricane since the 1928 Okeechobee Hurricane, killing at least 1,836\\u00a0people. The 1900 Galveston Hurricane remains the deadliest natural disaster in United States history, with a death toll of approximately 6,000.\\n\\nOn August 24, a vigorous tropical wave developed off the coast of Africa which eventually spawned an area of low pressure. The low gradually became better organized and was designated Tropical Depression Thirteen on August 28, about midway between the Lesser Antilles and Africa. However, northerly wind shear prevented the depression from strengthening and it degenerated into a broad low-pressure area the next day. After traveling rapidly towards the north the low regenerated into a tropical depression and shortly after was declared Tropical Storm Lee on August 31. Lee was only briefly a tropical storm before it weakened back to a tropical depression. The depression degenerated into a broad low-pressure area again before being absorbed by a cold front on September 4.\\n\\nSeptember\\nthumb|right|Hurricane Ophelia off the coast of North Carolina\\n\\nHurricane Maria led off the month of September, and formed into a tropical storm well east of the Leeward Islands on September 2. Maria reached its peak as a Category 3 hurricane on September 5, turning northeast and weakening before becoming extratropical on September 10. Unusually, this extratropical storm strengthened as it moved toward Iceland; its remnants struck Norway where one person was killed in a landslide.\\n\\nHurricane Nate formed southwest of Bermuda on September 5 and moved northeast as it strengthened into a strong Category\\u00a01 hurricane. Nate became extratropical on September 10; the storm never approached land, although it did interfere with Canadian naval vessels en route to the Gulf Coast to help in Katrina relief efforts.\\n\\nHurricane Ophelia formed as a tropical depression in the Bahamas on September 6 and almost immediately made landfall on Grand Bahama. It became a tropical storm off the coast of Florida before strengthening into a large Category\\u00a01 storm and raking a long stretch of the southern North Carolina coast with heavy winds and storm surge on September 12 and September 13. The hurricane's eye never made landfall and moved back out to sea before becoming extratropical on September 17 and striking Atlantic Canada. Total damage estimates were around $70\\u00a0million (2005 USD).\\n\\nHurricane Philippe formed east of the Leeward Islands on September 17. It moved northwards, reaching Category 1 intensity before weakening and dissipating on September 23. No landmasses were affected, although Bermuda's lowest pressure of September was recorded after Philippe passed near the island.\\n\\nthumb|left|Image of Hurricane Rita near peak strength\\n\\nHurricane Rita formed as a tropical storm over the Turks and Caicos Islands on September 18. The storm reached Category\\u00a02 intensity as it moved south of the Florida Keys on September 20. Rapid intensification ensued as Rita moved into the Gulf of Mexico, and Rita became a Category\\u00a05 hurricane on September 21, becoming the third (now fourth) most intense hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic Basin. Rita made landfall near the Texas-Louisiana border on September 24. Major flooding was reported in Port Arthur and Beaumont, Texas, while Cameron and Calcasieu parishes in Louisiana were devastated. Offshore oil platforms throughout Rita's path also suffered significant damage. Six people were killed by Rita's direct effects, and total damage from the storm was estimated at about $18.5\\u00a0billion (2005 USD). One hundred and thirteen indirect deaths were reported, mostly from the exodus from Houston, Texas and surrounding counties.\\n\\nTropical Depression Nineteen formed west of the Cape Verde Islands on September 30 but dissipated on October 2 without having threatened land.\\n\\nOctober\\nthumb|right|Hurricane Stan shortly before landfall in Veracruz\\nHurricane Stan was the first October storm, reaching tropical storm status on October 2 just before crossing the Yucat\\u00e1n Peninsula. In the Bay of Campeche, Stan briefly reached hurricane strength before making landfall south of Veracruz, Veracruz, on October 4. Stan was a part of a large system of rainstorms, which dropped torrential rainfall that caused catastrophic flooding and mudslides over southern Mexico and Central America. Well over 1,000 total deaths were caused by the flooding, of which 80\\u2013100 are directly attributed to Stan.\\n\\nAn initially unnoticed Unnamed Subtropical Storm was discovered by the NHC during the postseason analysis. This short-lived subtropical storm formed on October 4 south of the Azores and was absorbed by an extratropical low the next day, after passing over those islands.\\n\\nTropical Storm Tammy led a brief existence before making landfall in northeastern Florida on October 5. Tammy dropped heavy rains over portions of the southeast United States before merging with a frontal system that would eventually cause the Northeast U.S. flooding of October 2005.\\n\\nSubtropical Depression Twenty-two formed southeast of Bermuda on October 8. It dissipated the next day, although its remnants approached New England and contributed to the Northeast U.S. flooding of October 2005.\\n\\nHurricane Vince formed over unfavorably cold water in the East Atlantic near the Madeira Islands on October 8 as a subtropical storm. This Hurricane was first recorded by the NHC on October 9 when it became tropical, and shortly thereafter, it briefly strengthened into a hurricane. The storm made an even more unusual landfall in Spain on October 11, making it the first tropical cyclone to impact Spain since the 1842 Spain hurricane.\\nthumb|Hurricane Wilma near peak intensity of \\nHurricane Wilma formed on October 17 in the western Caribbean southwest of Jamaica and rapidly strengthened. On October 19 it became the strongest tropical cyclone on record in the Atlantic basin, with 185\\u00a0mph (295\\u00a0km/h) winds and a central pressure of . It then moved slowly and struck Quintana Roo on October 22 as a Category 4 hurricane, causing very heavy damage to Canc\\u00fan and Cozumel. Likewise, after emerging into the Gulf of Mexico, Wilma sharply changed directions and passed north of Cuba before striking southern Florida on the 24th as a Category\\u00a03 storm, then moving into the Atlantic Ocean and becoming extratropical. Wilma is directly credited with 23 deaths; total damage is estimated at around $27.4\\u00a0billion (2005 USD; $ \\u00a0USD), mostly in the United States, Mexico, and Cuba.\\n\\nTropical Storm Alpha formed in the eastern Caribbean on October 22 and crossed Hispaniola, causing major flooding before merging with Hurricane Wilma. A total of 42\\u00a0people were reported dead from the storm in Haiti and the Dominican Republic.\\n\\nHurricane Beta formed in the southern Caribbean on October 26 and strengthened into a Category\\u00a03 hurricane before making landfall in the Colombian islands of San Andr\\u00e9s & Providencia and in Nicaragua on October 30. As of 2012, Hurricane Beta was responsible for nine fatalities and more than $15.5 million in damage across four countries.\\n\\nNovember 2005, December 2005, and January 2006\\nthumb|right|Hurricane Epsilon viewed from the International Space Station\\nTropical activity declined very slowly as the season wound down. Tropical Storm Gamma initially formed on November 15 in the central Caribbean, and degenerated into a tropical wave before reforming. Although the storm dissipated on November 20 after having made landfall in northern Honduras, rainfall from Gamma caused 41 deaths in Honduras and Belize.\\n\\nTropical Storm Delta formed in the eastern Atlantic on November 23; it approached but never attained hurricane strength. Delta became extratropical on November 28 shortly before striking the Canary Islands at full force, causing seven deaths and toppling El Dedo de Dios, a famous land formation on Gran Canaria.\\n\\nHurricane Epsilon formed as a tropical storm on November 29 in a hostile environment in the middle of the Atlantic. It reached hurricane strength on December 2 and defied forecasting by persisting for over a week before dissipating.\\n\\nTropical Storm Zeta became the final storm of the season when it formed on December 30, six hours short of tying the record of Hurricane Alice of 1954 as the latest-forming named storm in a season. Zeta dissipated on January 6, 2006, having become the longest-lived January tropical cyclone in Atlantic basin history.\\n\\nDeaths and damage\\n\\nthumb|left|Damage in Navarre Beach, Florida from Hurricane Dennis\\nThe storms of the season were extraordinarily damaging and were responsible for significant loss of life. Total damage is estimated to be about $180.7\\u00a0billion (2005 US$), and an estimated 2,067\\u00a0people were confirmed dead. However, due to uncertainties in the death toll caused by Stan, the death toll from the season could be as high as 4,000\\u00a0people.\\n\\nThe hardest-hit area was the United States Gulf Coast from eastern Texas to the Florida Panhandle. First to strike the area was Hurricane Dennis, which caused $2.23\\u00a0billion in damage along the Florida Panhandle. Hurricane Katrina caused catastrophic damage to the Gulf Coast, devastating a long stretch of coast along Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama with a 30-foot (9\\u00a0m) storm surge. Wind damage was reported well inland, slowing down recovery efforts. Storm surge also breached levees in the city of New Orleans, Louisiana, flooding about 80% of the city. Total damage has been estimated at $125\\u00a0billion, and at least 1,836\\u00a0people were killed by the storm; Katrina is the second costliest hurricane in U.S. history, surpassing 1992's Hurricane Andrew, and the deadliest hurricane in the U.S. since 1928. Hurricane Rita struck near the same area, re-flooded New Orleans (though to a far less degree than Katrina), and caused extensive damage along the coastlines of Louisiana and Texas; total damage is estimated at about $18.5\\u00a0billion. Tropical Storm Arlene and Hurricane Cindy also struck the Gulf Coast but caused much lighter damage.\\n\\nthumb|Flooding in New Orleans from Hurricane Katrina\\nThe Mexican state of Quintana Roo was also heavily hit, suffering billions of dollars in damage when Hurricanes Emily and Wilma both made landfall between Cozumel and Canc\\u00fan. Wilma was particularly devastating, lashing the area with major hurricane-force winds for over a full day, and was possibly the most damaging hurricane in Mexican history.\\n\\nWilma caused widespread heavy damage in south Florida, causing $19\\u00a0billion in damage total in the United States. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita had struck the same area earlier, causing lesser (but still significant) damage, and Tropical Storm Arlene killed one person caught in a rip current. Hurricane Dennis also brushed the area on its track northward.\\n\\nIn October the remnants of Tropical Storm Tammy and Subtropical Depression Twenty-two met over the Northeastern United States, causing intense flooding.\\n\\nSoutheastern North Carolina suffered some damage from the slow-moving Hurricane Ophelia; damage from that storm were originally estimated at $1.6\\u00a0billion, but finalized at only $70\\u00a0million. The remainder of the Atlantic coast escaped the major storms, although some regions were affected by the remnants of several storms (including Katrina, Ophelia, Tammy, Subtropical Depression Twenty-two, and Wilma).\\n\\nNortheastern Mexico, including Veracruz and Tamaulipas, was struck repeatedly. Hurricane Emily struck Tamaulipas directly, causing severe damage. Tropical Storms Bret, Gert, and Jose also made landfall in the area but caused minimal damage, although they did cause 12 deaths.\\n\\nSouthern Mexico, along with portions of Central America, suffered heavy flooding and mudslides from Hurricane Stan and nearby nontropical rains. Over 1,600\\u00a0people were confirmed dead in total, with some towns completely wiped out, though most of these deaths were not directly related to the hurricane. Central America also suffered flooding from Tropical Storm Gamma and Hurricane Wilma, and Nicaragua was struck directly by Hurricane Beta. Gamma caused $13\\u201318 million (2005 USD) in damage to crops; no damage figures are available for any of the other storms.\\n\\nThe island of Hispaniola escaped the worst storms; however, at least 89\\u00a0people were killed in Haiti from the effects of Hurricanes Dennis and Wilma and Tropical Storm Alpha. The Leeward Islands were generally spared all the storms,  although Dennis and Emily caused significant damage in the Windward Islands.\\n\\nCuba was struck by Hurricane Dennis at peak strength, causing $1.4\\u00a0billion in damage; it was the worst hurricane to hit Cuba in over 40\\u00a0years. Some areas of Cuba also suffered heavy damage from Hurricanes Rita and Wilma.\\n\\nUnusual impacts were felt in Europe and nearby islands from four storms. Hurricane Maria intensified and affected northern Europe as a vicious extratropical storm, while Hurricane Vince maintained tropical characteristics onto the Iberian Peninsula as a weak tropical depression. Tropical Storm Delta struck the Canary Islands just after becoming extratropical, causing extensive damage before reaching Morocco as a weak extratropical system. In addition, the Azores were affected by the unnamed subtropical storm at its peak strength. Eight people were killed by those storms, and significant damage was reported as a result of Maria and Delta, although no figures are available.\\n\\nEconomic impact\\nthumb|Hurricane Rita at landfall, along with the location of several refineries\\nThe damage had far-reaching economic consequences due to vulnerability of both oil extracting and refining capacity in the Gulf of Mexico, storms led to speculative spikes in the price of crude oil whereas, the damage to refinery capacity in the United States caused gasoline to soar to record prices (even adjusted for inflation). Governments in Europe and the United States tapped strategic reserves of gasoline and petroleum, and shortages were reported in the days after Katrina in areas heavily dependent on the Gulf of Mexico for refined gasoline. Even weeks after the storm, prices remained elevated as the shortage in production remained over  per day.\\n\\nRita damaged wells in the western Gulf of Mexico which were primarily exploratory, leading to concerns that future production would be damped for some time to come. Additionally, as the storm churned in the Gulf, forecasters predicted that it would strike Houston, Texas, the location of many major oil refineries that survived Katrina, leading to additional spikes in oil prices before the predictions changed. In Georgia, Governor Sonny Perdue declared \\\"snow days\\\" on September 26 and September 27, 2005, at all Georgia public schools to conserve fuel for school buses in anticipation of Rita's impact. However, as the storm veered away from Houston shortly before landfall, damage to refining capacity was not as great as feared.\\n\\nAgriculture in multiple countries was hard hit by extremely heavy rains from severe storms during the season. Early in the season, Hurricane Dennis caused significant damage to various citrus and vegetable crops in Cuba, though the damage was not crippling. In Central America, Hurricane Stan and associated nontropical storms dropped upwards of 20\\u00a0inches (500\\u00a0mm) of rain, causing, in addition to severe flash floods and mud slides, heavy damage to crops, especially to the banana and coffee crops, which were nearly ready to be harvested. This caused significant economic disruption in Guatemala and surrounding nations, as the rural economies are highly dependent on the coffee and banana crops. When Hurricane Beta struck Nicaragua later in the season, it also caused heavy damage to the banana crop, but the harvests had already ended, mitigating economic disruption.\\n\\nKatrina also had significant political consequences, as President George W. Bush, Louisiana governor Kathleen Blanco, and New Orleans mayor Ray Nagin all came under heavy criticism for what were considered sluggish or inappropriate responses to Hurricane Katrina. On December 14, 2005, congressional hearings began to investigate whether these claims had any merit. In addition, Michael Brown, head of the United States Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), was forced to resign from his post after the organization came under fire for what was perceived as an insufficient response to Katrina.\\n\\nForecasting uncertainty\\nthumb|right|Hurricane Vince formed in cold waters in the northeast Atlantic.\\nA number of storms that formed in 2005 exhibited unusual behavior and challenged forecasters' ability to make correct predictions. Hurricane Vince formed farther northeast in the Atlantic than any other tropical cyclone on record at the time\\u2014only 2009's Grace has formed farther north\\u2014and then unexpectedly reached hurricane strength over waters considered too cold to support a hurricane. Hurricane Wilma became the fastest-intensifying hurricane on record, and later strengthened unexpectedly in the face of strong wind shear. Tropical Storm Delta, Hurricane Epsilon and Tropical Storm Zeta all formed over the cold waters of the late-season eastern Atlantic, much like Hurricane Vince (though at lower latitudes). All three persisted in the face of heavy wind shear, and Epsilon managed to reach hurricane strength over waters well below the temperatures previously thought necessary for hurricane formation. Epsilon became the longest-lasting December hurricane while Zeta became the longest-lasting storm in January.\\n\\nRecords and notable events\\nThe 2005 season broke numerous records for tropical cyclone activity, though it might not actually be the most active season in history, since records before 1944 are incomplete.\\n\\n+ Storm formation during the 2005 season Systems  Average  OldRecord  2005 Storms  10  21  28 Hurricanes  6  12  15 Category\\u00a03+ Hurricanes  2  7  7 Category\\u00a05 Hurricanes  0.3  2   4\\n\\nDuring the season, 28 storms were named, more than in any previously recorded Atlantic season. The season's activity was reflected with a very high cumulative accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 250. This total ranks it as the second-most active season on record, with only the 1933 season having a higher ACE value. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34\\u00a0knots (39\\u00a0mph, 63\\u00a0km/h) or tropical storm strength. Although officially, subtropical cyclones are excluded from the total, the figure above includes periods when storms were in a subtropical phase.\\n\\nThree out of the six most intense Atlantic hurricanes (by central pressure) on record occurred in 2005, topped off by Hurricane Wilma's  minimum pressure, shattering the 17-year-old record set by Hurricane Gilbert. Hurricanes Emily, Katrina and Rita also attained Category\\u00a05 intensity, and Hurricanes Rita and Katrina became the fourth- and sixth-most intense recorded Atlantic storms, respectively. Hurricane Emily was not originally recorded as a Category\\u00a05 storm, but it was upgraded into the post-storm status  by the National Hurricane Center. The  2005 season is the only season on record with four Category\\u00a05 storms on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale; the previous record was only two. In addition, Hurricane Dennis reached Category\\u00a04 status, tying the record set by the 1999 season with five Category\\u00a04 storms.\\n\\nStorm names\\n\\nThe following is a list of names used for tropical storms and hurricanes that formed in the North Atlantic in 2005.\\n\\n Arlene\\n Bret\\n Cindy\\n Dennis\\n Emily\\n Franklin\\n Gert\\n Harvey\\n Irene\\n Jose\\n Katrina\\n Lee\\n Maria\\n Nate\\n Ophelia\\n Philippe\\n Rita\\n Stan\\n Tammy\\n Vince\\n Wilma\\n Alpha\\n Beta\\n Gamma\\n Delta\\n Epsilon\\n Zeta\\n\\nThis was the same list used for the 1999 season, with the exceptions of Franklin and Lee, which replaced Floyd and Lenny. The names not retired from this list were used again in the 2011 Atlantic hurricane season. Storms were named Franklin, Lee, Maria, Nate, Ophelia, Philippe, Rita, Stan, Tammy, Vince, Wilma, Beta, Gamma, Epsilon, and Zeta for the first (and only, in the cases of Rita, Stan, and Wilma) time in 2005 (the names Alpha and Delta had been previously used in 1972 for two subtropical storms, but this is the first time they have been used in this way). This season used fifteen previously unused names, the most ever in an Atlantic season.  Additionally, a subtropical storm that formed in early October was not recognized as such at the time and so did not receive a name. Vince and Wilma were the first, and, so far, only, named \\\"V\\\" and \\\"W\\\" storms ever in the Atlantic basin. On April 6, 2006, the World Meteorological Organization retired five hurricane names: Dennis, Katrina, Rita, Stan, and Wilma.  Their replacements for the 2011 season were Don, Katia, Rina, Sean, and Whitney, respectively. It was also decided it \\\"was not practical to 'retire into hurricane history' a letter in the Greek Alphabet.\\\" Storms named with Greek letters that would otherwise be eligible for retirement would appear in the retired name list, but have a notation affixed with the circumstances.\\nThis surpassed the previous record for the number of hurricane names retired after a single season, four (held by the 1955, 1995, 2004, and 2017 seasons).\\n\\nSeason effects\\n\\nThis is a table of all of the storms that have formed during the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season.
