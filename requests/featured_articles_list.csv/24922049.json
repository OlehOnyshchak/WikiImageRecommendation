I hate to say that, because it's such a romantic song.\\\" He added, \\\"But it was the fight that did it. I was happy, and I wrote it in its entirety right there. I felt it would be good enough for the album. Out of the bliss comes magic, wonderment, and creativity.\\\"Jones, p. 283 Jackson would consider \\\"Speechless\\\" to be one of his favorite songs on Invincible.Michael Jackson's interview with Getmusic.com.

Michael sings the first eight bars a\\u00a0cappella. At the end, he closes it off a\\u00a0cappella\\u00a0\\u2013 it was Michael's idea to add the a\\u00a0cappella parts.\\\"Grant, p. 296\\n\\nComposition\\nThe lyrics to \\\"Speechless\\\" deal with being lost for words because of love. The song opens with Jackson's singing a\\u00a0cappella: \\\"Your love is magical, that's how I feel, but I have not the words here to explain\\\", which Rick de Yampert of The Daytona Beach News-Journal felt the singer \\\"[crooned] sweetly\\\". The chorus includes the lines, \\\"Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel. Though I'm with you, I am far away and nothing is for real.\\\" A second a\\u00a0cappella verse bookends the track.\\n\\n\\\"Speechless\\\" is a ballad, and labeled it as \\\"neo-gospel\\\". According to Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music Publishing. It adds that the track was performed in common time, with a tempo of 80\\u00a0beats per minute.

The song's vocal range is from F4 to B5.\\n\\nPost-production and release\\nIn June 2001, several months before the release of Invincible, \\\"Speechless\\\" was among several songs showcased from the album exclusively to executives of Jackson's music label, Epic Records (a subsidiary of Sony Music Entertainment). Other songs previewed included \\\"Unbreakable\\\", \\\"The Lost Children\\\", \\\"Whatever Happens\\\", \\\"Break of Dawn\\\", \\\"Heaven Can Wait\\\" and \\\"Privacy\\\", all of which featured on Invincibles track listing. Roger Friedman of Fox News reported that the executives who listened to the previews liked what they heard. Epic Records' president, Dave Glew, said of the tracks, \\\"It's wonderful and amazing. Michael is singing better than ever.\\\" He added, \\\"The ballads! The ballads are beautiful, and they're all there.\\\" \\\"Speechless\\\" was later released as a promotional single in 2001. A remixed version of \\\"You Rock My World\\\", featuring rapper Jay-Z, served as the single's B-side.Packaging of the \\\"Speechless\\\" promotional single by Michael Jackson After Jackson's death, a clip of the entertainer singing \\\"Speechless\\\" was included in Michael Jackson's This Is It, a commercially successful documentary-concert film of the singer's rehearsals for his London concert series.\\n\\nPlans to be performed on This Is It\\n\\\"Speechless\\\" was considered to be performed on cancelled This Is It concerts that planned to run from July 2009 to March 2010. However, this song was ultimately off the final set list. Later members of band shared set lists for the shows. \\\"Speechless\\\" was marked as an additional material. That set list was dated May 22, 2009.\\n\\nCritical reception\\nCraig Seymour of The Buffalo News felt that the song was the only one from the album in which Jackson successfully revisited his past. The journalist said the song was reminiscent of the 1995 chart-topper \\\"You Are Not Alone\\\", as it sounded to him like a track that could have been written by R. Kelly, who penned the number one hit. Writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, Jim DeRogatis described \\\"Speechless\\\" as a \\\"beautifully minimal, heartfelt romantic ballad\\\". Music journalist Roger Catlin stated that the song leaned toward \\\"neo-gospel\\\". The New York Post said that \\\"Speechless\\\" was \\\"lullaby-like\\\" and the best song on Invincible, and Jon Pareles of The New York Times praised Jackson's \\\"long lines and creamy overdubbed choruses [sailing] weightlessly\\\" in the ballad, that the journalist felt it was a love song to God.\\n\\nPop music critic Robert Hilburn described \\\"Speechless\\\", and another song from Invincible (\\\"Butterflies\\\"), as being \\\"as woefully generic as their titles\\\". Ben Rayner of the Toronto Star contested that the a\\u00a0cappellas in \\\"Speechless\\\" were enough to make a person wish that Jackson actually was unable to make a sound. Michigan Daily writer Dustin J. Seibert wrote that the song was a \\\"shining [example] of what happens when The Gloved One gets beside himself and writes smarmy crap that should be reserved for a CD changer somewhere in a preschool\\\". The Fort Worth Star-Telegram said that \\\"Speechless\\\" was one of the weaker tracks from Invincible. Elliot Sylvester of The Independent felt that the song was \\\"pure Jackson\\u00a0\\u2013 almost to a formulaic fault\\\". The Dallas Morning News Thor Christensen said that \\\"Speechless\\\" was \\\"produced by Mr. Jackson in bombastic style \\u00e0 la Celine Dion\\\". He added that as the track ended with an emotional Jackson, it drew a parallel with the singer's 1972 ode to a rat, \\\"Ben\\\".\\n\\nVaughn Watson of The Providence Journal hailed \\\"Speechless\\\" as Invincibles \\\"best song, and one of Jackson's finest of any album\\\". He added that with the song, the musician acknowledged the pain that accompanies isolation. In a review of Invincible, The Wichita Eagle stated that \\\"Speechless\\\", \\\"Don't Walk Away\\\" and \\\"Cry\\\" were among the \\\"sincere ballads\\\" in which Jackson was exemplary. Ada Anderson of The Ball State Daily News expressed the view that \\\"Speechless\\\" would become a popular song, and writers for the South Florida Sun-Sentinel stated that the ballad would take time to get used to. The Dayton Daily News Ron Rollins described the track as a \\\"pretty love song\\\". Music critic Kevin C. Johnson thought that \\\"Speechless\\\" was \\\"one of [Jackson's] typical, whispery ballads that swells as it moves along\\\". A journalist for The Olympian stated that the song was \\\"gorgeous\\\".\\n\\nTrack listing\\n Promotional CD single:\\n \\\"Speechless\\\"\\u00a0\\u2013 3:18\\n \\\"You Rock My World\\\" (Track Masters Mix) (featuring Jay-Z)\\u00a0\\u2013 3:28\\n\\nPersonnel\\n Written, composed, produced and lead vocal by Michael Jackson\\n Orchestra arranged and conducted by Michael Jackson and Jeremy Lubbock\\n Keyboards performed by Brad Buxer\\n Viola performed by Novi Novog and Thomas Tally\\n Violin performed by Peter Kent, Gina Kronstadt, Robin Lorentz, Kirstin Fife and John Wittenberg\\n\\nThriller\\u00a0\\u2013 Live cast version\\n\\nOn June 21, 2010, six performers in the West End of London show Thriller\\u00a0\\u2013 Live released \\\"Speechless\\\" as a single with the official name \\\"Speechless\\u00a0\\u2013 The Tribute to Michael Jackson\\\" to commemorate the one-year anniversary of Jackson's death.
