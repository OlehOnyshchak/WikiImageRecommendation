"{\"title\": \"In Utero (album)\", \"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Utero_%28album%29\", \"text\": \"In Utero is the third and final studio album by American rock band Nirvana, released on September 21, 1993, by DGC Records. Nirvana intended for the record to diverge significantly from the polished, refined production of its previous album, Nevermind (1991). To capture a more abrasive and natural sound, the group hired engineer Steve Albini to record In Utero during a two-week period in February 1993 at Pachyderm Studio in Cannon Falls, Minnesota.  The music was quickly recorded within that time with few studio embellishments. The song lyrics and album packaging largely incorporated medical imagery that conveyed frontman Kurt Cobain's outlook on his publicized personal life and his band's newfound fame.\\n\\nSoon after recording was completed, rumors circulated in the press that DGC might not release the album in its original state, as the record label felt that the result was not commercially viable.  Although Nirvana publicly denied the statements, the band opted to remix parts of the album.  Albini declined to alter the album further, and ultimately the band hired R.E.M. producer Scott Litt to make minor changes to the album's sound and remix the singles \\\"Heart-Shaped Box\\\" and \\\"All Apologies\\\".\\n\\nUpon release, In Utero entered the Billboard 200 chart at number one and received critical acclaim as a drastic departure from Nevermind.  The record has been certified five times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, and has sold 15 million copies worldwide.Nirvana: 20 Things You Didn't Know About 'In Utero' NME. dated September 10, 2013.

Nevertheless, all three members of Nirvana\\u2014singer and guitarist Kurt Cobain, bassist Krist Novoselic, and drummer Dave Grohl\\u2014later expressed dissatisfaction with the sound of the album, citing its production as too polished.Gaar, 2006. p. 70  Early in 1992, Cobain told Rolling Stone that he was sure that the band's next album would showcase \\\"both of the extremes\\\" of its sound, saying \\\"it'll be more raw with some songs and more candy pop on some of the others.  It won't be as one-dimensional [as Nevermind]\\\".Azerrad, Michael. \\\"Inside the Heart and Mind of Nirvana\\\". Rolling Stone. April 16, 1992.  Cobain wanted to start work on the album in the summer of 1992, but the band was unable as Cobain and his bandmates lived in different cities, and as the singer and his wife, Courtney Love, were expecting the birth of their daughter, Frances Bean.Azerrad, 1994. p. 312  DGC had hoped to have a new album by the band ready for a late-1992 holiday season release; since work on it proceeded slowly, the label released the compilation album Incesticide in December 1992.Gaar, Gillian G. \\\"Verse Chorus Verse: The Recording History of Nirvana\\\". Goldmine. February 14, 1997.\\n\\nIn a Melody Maker interview published in July 1992, Cobain told the English journalist Everett True that he was interested in recording with Jack Endino (who had produced the group's 1989 d\\u00e9but album Bleach) and Steve Albini (former frontman of the noise rock band Big Black and producer for various independent releases).  Cobain said he would then choose the best material from the sessions for inclusion on the group's next album.True, Everett. \\\"Nirvana: Crucified By Success?\\\" Melody Maker. July 25, 1992.  In October 1992, Nirvana recorded several songs (mainly as instrumentals) during a demo session with Endino in Seattle; they later re-recorded many of these songs for In Utero.Gaar, 2006. p. 17  Endino recalled that the band did not ask him to produce its next record, but noted that the band members constantly debated working with Albini.Gaar, 2006. p. 21\\u201322  The group recorded another set of demos while on tour in Brazil in January 1993.Gaar, 2006. p. 23  One of the recordings from this session, the long improvisational track \\\"Gallons of Rubbing Alcohol Flow Through the Strip\\\", was included as a hidden track on non-U.S. CD copies of In Utero.Gaar, 2006. p. 29\\u201330\\n\\nNirvana ultimately chose Albini to record its third album.  Albini had a reputation as a principled and opinionated individual in the American independent music scene.  While there was speculation that the band chose Albini to record the album due to his underground credentials, Cobain told Request magazine in 1993, \\\"For the most part I wanted to work with him because he happened to produce two of my favorite records, which were Surfer Rosa [by Pixies] and Pod [by The Breeders].\\\"  Inspired by those albums, Cobain wanted to utilize Albini's technique of capturing the natural ambiance of a room via the usage and placement of several microphones, something previous Nirvana producers had been averse to trying.DeRogatis, 2003. p. 5\\u20136  Months before the trio had even approached Albini about the recording, rumors circulated that he was slated to record the album.  Albini sent a disclaimer to the British music press denying involvement, only to get a call from Nirvana's management a few days later about the project.Azerrad, 1994. p. 313  Although he considered the group to be \\\"R.E.M. with a fuzzbox\\\" and \\\"an unremarkable version of the Seattle sound\\\", Albini told Nirvana biographer Michael Azerrad he accepted because he felt sorry for the band members, whom he perceived to be \\\"the same sort of people as all the small-fry bands I deal with\\\", at the mercy of their record company.Azerrad, 1994. p. 314  Before the start of recording sessions, the band sent Albini a tape of the demos it had made in Brazil.  In return, Albini sent Cobain a copy of the PJ Harvey album Rid of Me to give him an idea of the acoustics at the studio where they would record.Gaar, 2006. p. 39\\n\\nRecording\\nThe members of Nirvana and Albini decided on a self-imposed two-week deadline for recording the album.  Wary of interference by DGC, Albini suggested the band members pay for the sessions with their own money, which they agreed to.  Studio fees totaled US$24,000, while Albini took a flat fee of $100,000 for his services.  Despite the suggestions of Nirvana's management company Gold Mountain, Albini refused to take percentage points on record sales, even though he stood to earn about $500,000 in royalties.Cameron, Keith. \\\"This Is Pop\\\". Mojo. May 2001.  While a common practice among producers in the music industry, Albini refused to take royalties because he considered it to be immoral and \\\"an insult to the artist\\\".\\nalt=|thumb|A sign welcomes visitors to the secluded location of Pachyderm Studios (now Seedy Underbelly North), where Nirvana stayed in virtual solitude while recording the album\\nIn February 1993, Nirvana traveled to Pachyderm Studio in Cannon Falls, Minnesota, to record the album.Gaar, 2006. p. 40  Albini did not meet the band members until the first day of recording, though he had spoken to them beforehand about the type of album they wanted to make.  Albini observed that \\\"they wanted to make precisely the sort of record that I'm comfortable doing\\\".Gaar, 2006. p. 36\\u201337  The group stayed in a house located on the studio grounds during the recording sessions.  Novoselic compared the isolated conditions to a gulag; he added, \\\"There was snow outside, we couldn't go anywhere.  We just worked.\\\"  For most of the sessions, the only people present were the band members, Albini, and technician Bob Weston.Azerrad credits Weston as \\\"assistant engineer\\\", but the album liner notes list him as \\\"technician\\\".  The band made it clear to DGC and Gold Mountain that it did not want any intrusion during the album production, going as far as not playing any of the work in progress for its record label A&R representative.Azerrad, 1994. p. 315  To prevent the group's managers and label from interfering, Albini instituted a strict policy of ignoring everyone except for the band members; the producer explained that everyone associated with the group aside from the musicians themselves were \\\"the biggest pieces of shit I ever met\\\".DeRogatis, 2003. p. 16\\u201317\\n\\nThe band arrived at Pachyderm Studio without their equipment and spent much of the first three days waiting for it to arrive by mail.  However, once recording began on February 13, work moved quickly.  On most days the group began work around midday, took breaks for lunch and dinner, and continued work through midnight.  Cobain, Novoselic, and Grohl recorded their basic instrumental tracks together as a band.  The group utilized this set-up on all songs except for faster compositions like \\\"Very Ape\\\" and \\\"\\\", where the drums were recorded separately in a nearby kitchen due to its natural reverb.  Albini surrounded Grohl's drum kit with about 30 microphones.  Cobain added additional guitar tracks to about half of the songs, then added guitar solos, and finally vocals.  The band did not discard takes and kept virtually everything it captured on tape.  Albini felt he was more an engineer than a producer; despite his personal opinions, he ultimately let the band judge which were decent takes.Azerrad, 1994. p. 316  He said, \\\"Generally speaking, [Cobain] knows what he thinks is acceptable and what isn't acceptable [...]  He can make concrete steps to improve things that he doesn't think are acceptable.\\\"Azerrad, 1994. p. 317  Cobain reportedly recorded all his vocal tracks in six hours.Gaar, 2006. p. 61  The band completed recording in six days; Cobain had originally anticipated disagreements with Albini, who the singer heard \\\"was supposedly this sexist jerk\\\", but called the process \\\"the easiest recording we've ever done, hands down\\\".  The only disruption occurred a week into the sessions, when Courtney Love arrived because she missed Cobain.  The band, Love, and Albini refused to go into specifics, but Weston's girlfriend (who served as the studio's chef) stated that Love created tension by criticizing Cobain's work and being confrontational with everyone present.\\n\\nThe album was mixed over five days.  This rate was quick by Nirvana's standards, but not for Albini, who was used to mixing entire albums in a day or two.  On occasions when work on a song mix was not producing desired results, the band and Albini took the rest of the day off to watch nature videos, set things on fire, and make prank phone calls for amusement.Azerrad, 1994. p. 318\\u201319  The sessions were completed on February 26.Gaar, 2006. p. 64\\n\\nMusic and lyrics\\n\\nAlbini sought to produce a record that sounded nothing like Nevermind.  He felt the sound of Nevermind was \\\"sort of a standard hack recording that has been turned into a very, very controlled, compressed radio-friendly mix [...]  That is not, in my opinion, very flattering to a rock band.\\\"  Instead, the intention was to capture a more natural and visceral sound.  Albini refused to double-track Cobain's vocals and instead recorded him singing alone in a resonant room.  The producer noted the intensity of the singer's vocals on some tracks; he said, \\\"There's a really dry, really loud voice at the end of 'Milk It'\\u00a0... that was also done at the end of 'Rape Me', where [Cobain] wanted the sound of him screaming to just overtake the whole band.\\\"Gaar, 2006. p. 45  Albini achieved the album's sparse drum sound by simply placing several microphones around the room while Dave Grohl performed, picking up the natural reverberation of the room.  Albini explained, \\\"If you take a good drummer and put him in front of a drum kit that sounds good acoustically and just record it, you've done your job.\\\"\\n\\nAzerrad asserted in his 1993 biography Come as You Are: The Story of Nirvana that the music of In Utero showcased divergent sensibilities of abrasiveness and accessibility that reflected the upheavals Cobain experienced prior to the album's completion.  He wrote, \\\"The Beatlesque 'Dumb' happily coexists beside the all-out frenzied punk graffiti of 'Milk It,' while 'All Apologies' is worlds away from the apoplectic 'Scentless Apprentice.'  It's as if [Cobain] has given up trying to meld his punk and pop instincts into one harmonious whole.  Forget it.  This is war.\\\"  Cobain believed, however, that In Utero was not \\\"any harsher or any more emotional\\\" than any of Nirvana's previous records.Azerrad, 1994. p. 321  Novoselic concurred with Azerrad's comments that the album's music leaned more towards the band's \\\"arty, aggressive side\\\"; the bassist said, \\\"There's always been [Nirvana] songs like 'About a Girl' and there's always been songs like 'Paper Cuts'...  Nevermind came out kind of 'About a Girl'-y and this [album] came out more 'Paper Cuts'\\\".Azerrad, 1994. p. 332\\u201333  Cobain cited the track \\\"Milk It\\\" as an example of the more experimental and aggressive direction in which the band's music had been moving in the months prior to the sessions at Pachyderm Studio.Azerrad, 1994. p. 323  Novoselic viewed the album's singles \\\"Heart-Shaped Box\\\" and \\\"All Apologies\\\" as \\\"gateways\\\" to the more abrasive sound of the rest of the album, telling journalist Jim DeRogatis that once listeners played the record, they would discover \\\"this aggressive wild sound, a true alternative record\\\".DeRogatis, 2003. p. 18\\n\\nSeveral of the songs on In Utero had been written years prior to recording; some of them dated back to 1990.Gaar, 2006. p. 3  With tracks like \\\"Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle\\\", Cobain favored long song titles in reaction to contemporary alternative rock bands that utilized single-word titles.Azerrad, 1994. p. 326\\u201327  Cobain continued to work on the lyrics while recording at Pachyderm Studio.Gaar, 2006. p. 41  Nonetheless, Cobain told Darcey Steinke in Spin in 1993 that, in contrast to Bleach and Nevermind, the lyrics were \\\"more focused, they're almost built on themes.\\\"Steinke, Darcey. \\\"Smashing Their Heads on That Punk Rock\\\". Spin: pp. 42\\u201349. October 1993.  Michael Azerrad asserted that the lyrics were less impressionistic and more straightforward than in previous Nirvana songs.  Azerrad also noted that \\\"[v]irtually every song contains some image of sickness and disease\\\".  In a number of songs, Cobain made reference to books he had read.  \\\"Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle\\\" was inspired by Shadowland, a 1978 biography of actress Frances Farmer, with whom Cobain had been fascinated ever since he read the book in high school.Gaar, 2006. p. 50\\u201351  The song \\\"Scentless Apprentice\\\" was written about Perfume: The Story of a Murderer, a historical horror novel about a perfumer's apprentice born with no body odor of his own but with a highly developed sense of smell, and who attempts to create the \\\"ultimate perfume\\\" by killing virgin women and taking their scent.Gaar, 2006. p. 42\\u201343\\n\\nCobain stated in a 1993 interview with The Observer that \\\"for the most part [In Utero]'s very impersonal\\\".Savage, Jon. \\\"Sounds Dirty: The Truth About Nirvana\\\". The Observer. August 15, 1993.  The songwriter also told Q that year that the abundance of infant and childbirth imagery on the album and his newfound fatherhood were coincidental.Sutcliffe, Phil. \\\"Kurt Cobain: King of Pain\\\". Q. October 1993.  However, Azerrad argued that much of the album contains personal themes, noting that Grohl held a similar view.  Grohl said, \\\"A lot of what he has to say is related to a lot of the shit he's gone through.  And it's not so much teen angst anymore.  It's a whole different ball game: rock star angst.\\\"Azerrad, 1994. p. 322  Cobain downplayed recent events (\\\"I really haven't had that exciting a life\\\") and told Azerrad that he did not want to write a track that explicitly expressed his anger at the media, but the author countered that \\\"Rape Me\\\" seemed to deal with that very issue.  While Cobain said the song was written long before his troubles with drug addiction became public, he agreed that the song could be viewed in that light.Azerrad, 1994, p. 322\\u201323  \\\"Serve The Servants\\\" contains comments about Cobain's life, both as a child and as an adult.  The opening lines \\\"Teenage angst has paid off well/Now I'm bored and old\\\" were a reference to Cobain's state of mind in the wake of Nirvana's success.Azerrad, 1994. p. 325  Cobain dismissed the media attention given to the effect his parents' divorce had on his life with the line \\\"That legendary divorce is such a bore\\\" from the chorus, and directly addressed his father with the lines \\\"I tried hard to have a father/But instead I had a dad/I just want you to know that I don't hate you anymore/There is nothing I could say that I haven't thought before\\\".  Cobain said he wanted his father to know he did not hate him, but had no desire to talk to him.Azerrad, 1994. p. 326\\n\\nPackaging and title\\nCobain originally wanted to name the album I Hate Myself and I Want to Die, a phrase that had originated in his journals in mid-1992.Cross, 2001. p. 277  At the time, the singer used the phrase as a response whenever someone asked him how he was doing.  Cobain intended the album title as a joke; he stated he was \\\"tired of taking this band so seriously and everyone else taking it so seriously\\\".Azerrad, 1994. p. 330  Novoselic convinced Cobain to change the title due to fear that it could potentially result in a lawsuit.  The band then considered using Verse Chorus Verse\\u2014a title taken from its song \\\"Verse Chorus Verse\\\", and an earlier working title of \\\"Sappy\\\"\\u2014before eventually settling on In Utero.  The final title was taken from a poem written by Courtney Love.Cross, 2001. p. 278\\n\\nThe art director for In Utero was Robert Fisher, who had designed all of Nirvana's releases on DGC.  Most of the ideas for the artwork for the album and related singles came from Cobain.  Fisher recalled that \\\"[Cobain] would just give me some loose odds and ends and say 'Do something with it.'\\\"Gaar, 2006. p. 79  The cover of the album is an image of a Transparent Anatomical Manikin, with angel wings superimposed.  Cobain created the collage on the back cover, which he described as \\\"Sex and woman and In Utero and vaginas and birth and death\\\", that consists of model fetuses, a turtle shell and models of turtles, and body parts lying in a bed of orchids and lilies.  The collage had been set up on the floor of Cobain's living room and was photographed by Charles Peterson after an unexpected call from Cobain.Gaar, 2006. p. 83  The album's track listing and re-illustrated symbols from Barbara G. Walker's The Woman's Dictionary of Symbols and Sacred Objects were then positioned around the edge of the collage.Gaar, 2006. p. 84\\n\\nProduction controversy and remixing\\nAfter the recording sessions were completed, Nirvana sent unmastered tapes of the album to several individuals, including the president of DGC's parent company Geffen Records Ed Rosenblatt and the group's management company Gold Mountain.  When asked about the feedback he received, Cobain told Michael Azerrad, \\\"The grown-ups don't like it.\\\"  He said he was told his songwriting was \\\"not up to par\\\", the sound was \\\"unlistenable\\\", and that there was uncertainty that mainstream radio would welcome the sound of Albini's production.Azerrad, 1994. p. 331  There were few people at Geffen or Gold Mountain who wanted the band to record with Albini to begin with, and Cobain felt he was receiving an unstated message to scrap the sessions and start all over again.  Cobain was upset and said to Azerrad, \\\"I should just re-record this record and do the same thing we did last year because we sold out last year\\u2014there's no reason to try and redeem ourselves as artists at this point.  I can't help myself\\u2014I'm just putting out a record I would like to listen to at home.\\\"  However, a number of the group's friends liked the album, and by April 1993, Nirvana was intent on releasing In Utero as it was.  According to Cobain, \\\"Of course, they want another Nevermind, but I'd rather die than do that.  This is exactly the kind of record I would buy as a fan, that I would enjoy owning.\\\"Azerrad, 1994. p. 332\\n\\nThe band members began to have doubts about the record's sound.  During this time, Cobain admitted, \\\"The first time I played it at home, I knew there was something wrong.  The whole first week I wasn't really interested in listening to it at all, and that usually doesn't happen.  I got no emotion from it, I was just numb.\\\"Mothersole, Ben. \\\"Nirvana's Kurt Cobain: Getting to Know Utero\\\". Circus. November 30, 1993.  The group concluded that the bass and lyrics were inaudible and approached Albini to remix the album.  The producer declined; as he recalled, \\\"[Cobain] wanted to make a record that he could slam down on the table and say, 'Listen, I know this is good, and I know your concerns about it are meaningless, so go with it.'  And I don't think he felt he had that yet\\u00a0...  My problem was that I feared a slippery slope.\\\"Gaar, 2006. p. 69  The band attempted to fix its concerns with the record during the mastering process with Bob Ludwig at his studio in Portland, Maine.  Novoselic was pleased with the results, but Cobain still did not feel the sound was perfect.Azerrad, 1994. p. 336\\nalt=|thumb|Audio mastering technician Bob Ludwig (pictured in 2008) was recruited to help make the album sound acceptable to DGC Records.\\n\\nSoon afterward, in April 1993, Albini remarked to the Chicago Tribune that he doubted Geffen would release the completed album.Kot, Greg. \\\"Record Label Finds Little Bliss in Nirvana's Latest\\\". Chicago Tribune. April 19, 1993.  Albini commented years later that in a sense he felt he spoke about the situation \\\"from a position of ignorance, because I wasn't there when the band was having their discussions with the record label.  All I know is\\u00a0... we made a record, everybody was happy with it.  A few weeks later I hear that it's unreleasable and it's all got to be redone\\\".Gaar, 2006. p. 66  While Albini's remarks in the article drew no immediate reply from the group or its label, Newsweek ran a similar article soon afterwards that did.Goodman, Fred. \\\"Nirvana to 'Newsweek': Drop dead\\\". Rolling Stone. June 24, 1993.  Nirvana denied there was any pressure from its label to change the album's sound, sending a letter to Newsweek that said that the article's author \\\"ridiculed our relationship with our label based on totally erronous  information\\\"; the band also reprinted the letter in a full-page ad in Billboard.  Rosenblatt insisted in a press release that Geffen would release anything the band submitted, and label founder David Geffen made the unusual move of personally calling Newsweek to complain about the article.Azerrad, 1994. p. 336\\u201337\\n\\nNirvana wanted to do further work on the recorded tracks, and considered working with producer Scott Litt and remixing some tracks with Andy Wallace (who had mixed Nevermind).  Albini vehemently disagreed, and claimed he had an agreement with the band that it would not modify the tracks without his involvement.  Albini initially refused to give the album master tapes to Gold Mountain, but relented after a phone call from Novoselic.  The band decided against working with Wallace and chose to remix and augment the songs \\\"Heart-Shaped Box\\\" and \\\"All Apologies\\\" with Litt at Seattle's Bad Animals Studio in May 1993.Azerrad, 1994. p. 337\\u201338  Furthermore, a remix of \\\"Pennyroyal Tea\\\" by Scott Litt (at Bad Animals on November 22, 1993) appears on the censored Wal-Mart and Kmart versions of In Utero; this remix is also available on the band's 2002 best-of compilation, Nirvana, and is the same mix that appeared on the single.  One song, \\\"I Hate Myself and Want to Die\\\", was omitted from the final track listing as Cobain felt there were too many \\\"noise\\\" songs on the album.DeRogatis, 2003. p. 6  The rest of the album was left unaltered aside from a remastering which sharpened the bass guitar sound and increased the volume of the vocals by approximately three decibels.Azerrad, 1994. p. 338  Albini was critical of the album's final mix; he said, \\\"The end result, the record in the stores doesn't sound all that much like the record that was made.  Though it's still them singing and playing their songs, and the musical quality of it still comes across.\\\"\\n\\nRelease\\nTo avoid over-hyping the album, DGC Records took a low-key approach to promoting In Utero; the company's head of marketing told Billboard before the album's release that the label was taking a promotional strategy similar to that of Nevermind, and explained that the label would \\\"set things up, duck, and get out of the way\\\".  The label aimed its promotion at alternative markets and press, and released the album on vinyl record as part of this strategy.Rosen, Craig. \\\"Nirvana Set Has Smell of Success\\\". Billboard. September 25, 1993.  In contrast to the previous album, the label did not release any of In Uteros singles commercially in the United States.  DGC sent promo copies of the album's first single, \\\"Heart-Shaped Box\\\", to American college, modern rock, and album-oriented rock radio stations in early September, but the label did not target Top 40 radio.  Despite the label's promotion, the band was convinced that In Utero would not be as successful as Nevermind.  Cobain told Jim DeRogatis, \\\"We're certain that we won't sell a quarter as much, and we're totally comfortable with that because we like this record so much.\\\"DeRogatis, 2003. p. 4\\n\\nIn Utero was released on September 13, 1993, on vinyl record and cassette tape in the United Kingdom, and on September 14 on vinyl in the United States, with the American vinyl pressing limited to 25,000 copies.Gaar, 2006. p. 97\\\"In the Works: Pearl Jam on Vinyl\\\".
