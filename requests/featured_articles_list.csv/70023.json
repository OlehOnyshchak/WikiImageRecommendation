Mysore City Corporation is responsible for the civic administration of the city, which is also the headquarters of the Mysore district and the Mysore division.\\n\\nIt served as the capital city of the Kingdom of Mysore for nearly six centuries from 1399 until 1956. The Kingdom was ruled by the Wadiyar dynasty, with a brief period of interregnum in the 1760s and 70s when Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan were in power. The Wadiyars were patrons of art and culture and contributed significantly to the cultural and economic growth of the city and the state. The cultural ambiance and achievements of Mysore earned it the sobriquet Cultural Capital of Karnataka.\\n\\nMysore is noted for its heritage structures and palaces, including the Mysore Palace, and for the festivities that take place during the Dasara festival when the city receives many tourists from around the world. It lends its name to various art forms and culture, such as Mysore Dasara, Mysore Painting; the sweet dish Mysore Pak, Mysore Masala Dosa; brands such as Mysore Sandal Soap, Mysore Ink; and styles and cosmetics such as Mysore Peta (a traditional silk turban) and the Mysore Silk sarees. Tourism is the major industry alongside the traditional industries. Mysore's inter-city public transportation includes rail, bus and flights.\\n\\nEtymology\\nThe name Mysore is an anglicised version of Mahish\\u016bru, which means the abode of Mahisha in the vernacular Kannada. The common noun Mahisha, in Sanskrit, means buffalo; in this context, however, Mahisha refers to Mahishasura, a mythical demon who could assume the form of both human and buffalo, who, according to Hindu mythology, ruled the ancient parts of Mysore Kingdom, known in Sanskrit as Mah\\u00ed\\u0161haka, centred at Mahishapura. He was killed by the Goddess Chamundeshwari, whose temple is situated atop the Chamundi Hills, after whom it is named. 'Mahishapura' later became Mahis\\u016bru (a name which, even now, the royal family uses), and finally came to be anglicised as Mysore by the British and Mais\\u016bru/Mysuru in the vernacular Kannada language.Deve Gowda Javare Gowda (1998), p. 82.\\n\\nIn December 2005, the Government of Karnataka announced its intention to change the English name of the city to Mysuru. This was approved by the Government of India in October 2014 and Mysore was renamed (along with twelve other cities) to \\\"Mysuru\\\" on 1 November 2014.\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nThe site where Mysore Palace now stands was occupied by a village named Puragere at the beginning of the 16th century. The Mahish\\u016bru Fort was constructed in 1524 by Chamaraja Wodeyar III (1513\\u20131553), who passed on the dominion of Puragere to his son Chamaraja Wodeyar IV (1572\\u20131576). Since the 16th century, the name of Mahish\\u016bru has commonly been used to denote the city. The Mysore Kingdom, governed by the Wodeyar family, initially served as a vassal state of the Vijayanagara Empire. With the decline of the Vijayanagara Empire after the Battle of Talikota in 1565, the Mysore Kingdom gradually achieved independence, and by the time of King Narasaraja Wodeyar (1637) it had become a sovereign state. Seringapatam (modern-day Srirangapatna), near Mysore, was the capital of the kingdom from 1610. The 17th century saw a steady expansion of its territory and, under Narasaraja Wodeyar I and Chikka Devaraja Wodeyar, the kingdom annexed large expanses of what is now southern Karnataka and parts of Tamil Nadu, to become a powerful state in the southern Deccan.\\n\\nThe kingdom reached the height of its military power and dominion in the latter half of the 18th century under the de facto rulers Hyder Ali and his son Tipu Sultan. The latter demolished parts of Mysore to remove legacies of the Wodeyar dynasty. During this time, Mysore kingdom came into conflict with the Marathas, the British and the Nizam of Golconda, leading to the four Anglo-Mysore wars, success in the first two of which was followed by defeat in the third and fourth. After Tipu Sultan's death in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War in 1799, the capital of the kingdom was moved back to Mysore from Seringapatam, and the kingdom was distributed by the British to their allies of the Fourth Mysore war. The landlocked interior of the previous Mysore Kingdom was turned into a princely state under the suzerainty of the British Crown. The former Wodeyar rulers were reinstated as puppet monarchs, now styled Maharajas. The British administration was assisted locally by Diwan (chief minister) Purnaiah. Purnaiah is credited with improving Mysore's public works. Mysore lost its status as the administrative centre of the kingdom in 1831, when the British commissioner moved the capital to Bangalore. It regained that status in 1881 and remained the capital of the Princely State of Mysore within the British Indian Empire until India became independent in 1947.\\n\\nThe Mysore municipality was established in 1888 and the city was divided into eight wards. In 1897 an outbreak of bubonic plague killed nearly half of the population of the city. With the establishment of the City Improvement Trust Board (CITB) in 1903, Mysore became one of the first cities in Asia to undertake planned development of the city. Public demonstrations and meetings were held there during the Quit India movement and other phases of the Indian independence movement.\\n\\nAfter Indian Independence, Mysore city remained as part of the Mysore State, now known as Karnataka. Jayachamarajendra Wodeyar, then king of Mysore, was allowed to retain his titles and was nominated as the Rajapramukh (appointed governor) of the state. He died in September 1974 and was cremated in Mysore city. Over the years, Mysore became well known as a centre for tourism; the city remained largely peaceful, except for occasional riots related to the Kaveri river water dispute. Among the events that took place in Mysore and made national headlines were a fire at a television studio that claimed 62 lives in 1989, and the sudden deaths of many animals at the Mysore Zoo.\\n\\n Geography \\n Area and extent \\nthumb|right|upright|Chamundi Hills seen from J.

The dispute between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu over the sharing of Kaveri river water often leads to minor altercations and demonstrations in the city. Growth in the information technology industry in Mysore has led to a change in the city's demographic profile; likely strains on the infrastructure and haphazard growth of the city resulting from the demographic change have been a cause of concern for some of its citizens.\\n\\nEconomy\\nTourism is the major industry in Mysore. The city attracted about 3.15\\u00a0million tourists in 2010. Mysore has traditionally been home to industries such as weaving, sandalwood carving, bronze work and the production of lime and salt.

Modern education began in Mysore when a free English school was established in 1833. Maharaja's College was founded in 1864. A high school exclusively for girls was established in 1881 and was later renamed Maharani's Women's College. The Industrial School, the first institute for technical education in the city, was established in 1892; this was followed by the Chamarajendra Technical Institute in 1913. While the modern system of education have made inroads, colleges such as the Mysore Sanskrit P\\u0101tha\\u015bh\\u0101la, established in 1876, still continue to provide Vedic education.\\n\\nThe modern education system was enhanced by the establishment of the University of Mysore in 1916 by Maharaja Krishnarajendra Wadiyar IV. Until reorganisation and renaming of Mysore State, Mysore University was the supreme university and prescribed education in and around the Kingdom of Mysore. Various disciplines were, later, delegated to subsidiary institutions, which later grew up to universities. Owing to a rapid increase in the student population, department of medicine was transferred to Rajiv Gandhi University in 1984. Later, in 1998, a surge in engineering disciplines and students forced the spawning of Visvesvaraya Technological University. Old institutes that were affiliated of the University in these disciplines now continue to operate in affiliation to the new ones or in autonomy: Mysore Medical College & Research Institute is affiliated to Rajiv Gandhi University, while engineering and technical institutions like the National Institute of Engineering and SJCE function autonomously.\\n\\n Universities headquartered in Mysore \\n\\nEstablishedUniversityTypeLevelSpecialisation1916University of MysorePublicUndergraduate, graduate, post-graduate, and doctoral researchMulti-disciplinary2008JSS UniversityPrivate1996Karnataka State Open UniversityPublic2008Karnataka State Music UniversityMusic\\n\\n Autonomous institutes headquartered in Mysore \\nEstablishedInstituteTypeCommissioning Body/AffiliationLevelSpecialisation1992Mahajana Law CollegePrivateAffiliated to \\u00a0 Mysore UniversityUndergraduate, LLBLaw1924Mysore Medical College & Research InstitutePublicAffiliated to \\u00a0Rajiv Gandhi University of Health SciencesUndergraduate, graduate,  post-graduate, and doctoral researchMedicine1928Yuvaraja's College, MysorePublicUniversity of MysoreBasic Science1946National Institute of EngineeringGovernment-aided privateAffiliated to Visvesvaraya Technological UniversityEngineering1950Central Food Technological Research InstitutePublicSet up by the Council of Scientific and Industrial ResearchResearch and developmentFood technology1961Defence Food Research LaboratorySet up by the Defence Research and Development OrganisationDefence and contingency food technology1963Regional Institute of Education, Mysore (NCERT)GovernmentAffiliated to University of MysoreEducation1963Sri Jayachamarajendra College of EngineeringGovernment-aided privateAffiliated to Deemed University and \\u00a0All India Council for Technical EducationUndergraduate, graduate,  post-graduate, and doctoral researchEngineering1966All India Institute of Speech and HearingPublicCommissioned by the Central Ministry of Health and Family WelfareAudiology, speech, and hearing1984JSS Medical CollegePrivateJSS UniversityMedicine1982JSS Law CollegePrivateAutonomous under Karnataka State Law University, HubballiUndergraduate, graduate,  post-graduateLaw 1945Sarada Vilas CollegePrivateAffiliated to Mysore UniversityUndergraduate, Graduate, LLB, PharmacyEducational\\n\\nCulture\\n\\nthumb|left|upright|alt=A photo depicting the Mysore style of painting|Mysore painting depicting the goddess Saraswati\\nReferred to as the cultural capital of Karnataka, Mysore is well known for the festivities that take place during the period of Dasara, the state festival of Karnataka.

The Dasara festivities culminate on the night of Vijayadashami with a torchlight parade, known locally as Panjina Kavayatthu.\\n\\nMysore is called the City of Palaces because of several ornate examples in the city. Among the most notable are Amba Vilas, popularly known as Mysore Palace; Jaganmohana Palace, which also serves as an art gallery; Rajendra Vilas, also known as the summer palace; Lalitha Mahal, which has been converted into a hotel; and Jayalakshmi Vilas.

Gopalaswamy, a professor of psychology, at his house in the Vontikoppal area of Mysore, using a 50-watt transmitter. The station was taken over by the princely state of Mysore in 1941 and was moved to Bangalore in 1955. In 1957, Akashvani was chosen as the official name of All India Radio (AIR), the radio broadcaster of the Government of India.
