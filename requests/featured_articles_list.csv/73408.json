"{\"title\": \"To Kill a Mockingbird\", \"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Kill_a_Mockingbird\", \"text\": \"To Kill a Mockingbird is a novel by Harper Lee published in 1960. Instantly successful, widely read in high schools and middle schools in the United States,  it has become a classic of modern American literature, winning the Pulitzer Prize. The plot and characters are loosely based on Lee's observations of her family, her neighbors and an event that occurred near her hometown of Monroeville, Alabama, in 1936, when she was 10\\u00a0years old.\\n    \\nThe novel is renowned for its warmth and humor, despite dealing with the serious issues of rape and racial inequality. The narrator's father, Atticus Finch, has served as a moral hero for many readers and as a model of integrity for lawyers. Historian, J. Crespino explains, \\\"In the twentieth century, To Kill a Mockingbird is probably the most widely read book dealing with race in America, and its main character, Atticus Finch, the most enduring fictional image of racial heroism.\\\"\\n\\nAs a Southern Gothic and Bildungsroman novel, the primary themes of To Kill a Mockingbird involve racial injustice and the destruction of innocence.  Scholars have noted that Lee also addresses issues of class, courage, compassion, and gender roles in the American Deep South.  The book is widely taught in schools in the United States with lessons that emphasize tolerance and decry prejudice. Despite its themes, To Kill a Mockingbird has been subject to campaigns for removal from public classrooms, often challenged for its use of racial epithets.\\n\\nReaction to the novel varied widely upon publication. Despite the number of copies sold and its widespread use in education, literary analysis of it is sparse. Author Mary McDonough Murphy, who collected individual impressions of To Kill a Mockingbird by several authors and public figures, calls the book \\\"an astonishing phenomenon\\\".Zipp, Yvonne (July 7, 2010). \\\"Scout, Atticus & Boo\\\", The Christian Science Monitor.

In 2006, British librarians ranked the book ahead of the Bible as one \\\"every adult should read before they die\\\".Pauli, Michelle (March 2, 2006). \\\"Harper Lee tops librarians' must-read list\\\", Guardian Unlimited. Retrieved on February 13, 2008. It was adapted into an Academy Award-winning film in 1962 by director Robert Mulligan, with a screenplay by Horton Foote. Since 1990, a play based on the novel has been performed annually in Harper Lee's hometown.\\n\\nTo Kill a Mockingbird was Lee's only published book until Go Set a Watchman, an earlier draft of To Kill a Mockingbird, was published on July 14, 2015. Lee continued to respond to her work's impact until her death in February 2016, although she had refused any personal publicity for herself or the novel since 1964.\\n\\n Biographical background and publication \\nBorn in 1926, Harper Lee grew up in the Southern town of Monroeville, Alabama, where she became close friends with soon-to-be famous writer  Truman Capote. She attended Huntingdon College in Montgomery (1944\\u201345), and then studied law at the University of Alabama (1945\\u201349). While attending college, she wrote for campus literary magazines: Huntress at Huntingdon and the humor magazine Rammer Jammer at the University of Alabama. At both colleges, she wrote short stories and other works about racial injustice, a rarely mentioned topic on such campuses at the time.Shields, pp. 79\\u201399. In 1950, Lee moved to New York City, where she worked as a reservation clerk for British Overseas Airways Corporation; there, she began writing a collection of essays and short stories about people in Monroeville. Hoping to be published, Lee presented her writing in 1957 to a literary agent recommended by Capote. An editor at J. B. Lippincott, who bought the manuscript, advised her to quit the airline and concentrate on writing.\\n\\nDonations from friends allowed her to write uninterruptedly for a year.Nelle Harper Lee Alabama Academy of Honor: Alabama Department of Archives and History (2001). Retrieved on November 13, 2007. After finishing the first draft and returning it to Lippincott, the manuscript, at that point titled \\\"Go Set a Watchman\\\",  fell into the hands of Therese von Hohoff Torrey, known professionally as Tay Hohoff. Hohoff was impressed, \\\"[T]he spark of the true writer flashed in every line,\\\" she would later recount in a corporate history of Lippincott, but as Hohoff saw it, the manuscript was by no means fit for publication. It was, as she described it, \\\"more a series of anecdotes than a fully conceived novel.\\\" During the following two and a half years, she led Lee from one draft to the next until the book finally achieved its finished form.\\n\\nAfter the \\\"Watchman\\\" title was rejected, it was re-titled Atticus but Lee renamed it To Kill a Mockingbird to reflect that the story went beyond a character portrait. The book was published on July 11, 1960.Shields, p. 129. The editorial team at Lippincott warned Lee that she would probably sell only several thousand copies.Shields, p. 14. In 1964, Lee recalled her hopes for the book when she said,\\n\\nI never expected any sort of success with 'Mockingbird.'\\u00a0...\\u00a0I was hoping for a quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers but, at the same time, I sort of hoped someone would like it enough to give me encouragement. Public encouragement. I hoped for a little, as I said, but I got rather a whole lot, and in some ways this was just about as frightening as the quick, merciful death I'd expected.\\n\\nInstead of a \\\"quick and merciful death\\\", Reader's Digest Condensed Books chose the book for reprinting in part, which gave it a wide readership immediately.Shields, p.\\u00a0242. Since the original publication, the book has never been out of print.Johnson, Casebook p. xii\\n\\n Plot summary \\n\\nThe story, told by the six-year-old Jean Louise Finch, takes place during three years (1933\\u201335) of the Great Depression in the fictional \\\"tired old town\\\" of Maycomb, Alabama, the seat of Maycomb County. Jean Louise Finch, nicknamed Scout, lives with her older brother Jeremy, nicknamed Jem, and their widowed father Atticus, a middle-aged lawyer. Jem and Scout befriend a boy named Dill, who visits Maycomb to stay with his aunt each summer. The three children are terrified, yet fascinated by their neighbor, the reclusive Arthur \\\"Boo\\\" Radley. The adults of Maycomb are hesitant to talk about Boo, and few of them have seen him for many years.  The children feed one another's imagination with rumors about his appearance and reasons for remaining hidden, and they fantasize about how to get him out of his house. After two summers of friendship with Dill, Scout and Jem find that someone is leaving them small gifts in a tree outside the Radley place. Several times the mysterious Boo makes gestures of affection to the children, but, to their disappointment, he never appears in person.\\n\\nJudge Taylor appoints Atticus to defend Tom Robinson, a black man who has been accused of raping a young white woman, Mayella Ewell. Although many of Maycomb's citizens disapprove, Atticus agrees to defend Tom to the best of his ability. Other children taunt Jem and Scout for Atticus's actions, calling him a \\\"nigger-lover\\\". Scout is tempted to stand up for her father's honor by fighting, even though he has told her not to. One night, Atticus faces a group of men intent on lynching Tom. This crisis is averted in an unexpected manner: Scout, Jem, and Dill show up, and Scout inadvertently breaks the mob mentality by recognizing and talking to a classmate's father, and the would-be lynchers disperse.\\n\\nAtticus does not want Jem and Scout to be present at Tom Robinson's trial. No seat is available on the main floor, but the Rev. Sykes invites Jem, Scout, and Dill to watch from the colored balcony. Atticus establishes that Mayella and Bob Ewell are lying. It is revealed that Mayella made sexual advances toward Tom, subsequently resulting in her being beaten by her father. The townspeople refer to the Ewells as \\\"white trash\\\" who are not to be trusted, but the jury convicts Tom regardless. Jem's faith in justice is badly shaken. Atticus is hopeful that he can get the verdict overturned, but Tom is shot and killed while trying to escape from prison.\\n\\nDespite Tom's conviction, Bob Ewell is humiliated by the events of the trial, Atticus explaining that he \\\"destroyed [Ewell's] last shred of credibility at that trial.\\\"Lee, p. 249 Ewell vows revenge, spitting in Atticus' face, trying to break into the judge's house, and menacing Tom Robinson's widow. Finally, he attacks Jem and Scout while they are walking home on a dark night after the school Halloween pageant. Jem suffers a broken arm in the struggle, but amid the confusion someone comes to the children's rescue. The mysterious man carries Jem home, where Scout realizes that he is Boo Radley.\\n\\nSheriff Tate arrives and discovers Ewell dead from a knife wound. Atticus believes that Jem was responsible, but Tate is certain it was Boo. The sheriff decides that, to protect Boo's privacy, he will report that Ewell simply fell on his own knife during the attack. Boo asks Scout to walk him home. After she says goodbye to him at his front door, he disappears, never to be seen again by Scout. While standing on the Radley porch, Scout imagines life from Boo's perspective.\\n\\n Autobiographical elements \\nLee said that To Kill a Mockingbird is not an autobiography, but rather an example of how an author \\\"should write about what he knows and write truthfully\\\".\\\"Harper Lee,\\\" in American Decades. Gale Research, 1998. Nevertheless, several people and events from Lee's childhood parallel those of the fictional Scout. Lee's father, Amasa Coleman Lee, was an attorney, similar to Atticus Finch, and in 1919, he defended two black men accused of murder. After they were convicted, hanged and mutilated,Shields, pp. 120\\u2013121. he never tried another criminal case. Lee's father was also the editor and publisher of the Monroeville newspaper. Although more of a proponent of racial segregation than Atticus, he gradually became more liberal in his later years.Shields, pp. 122\\u2013125. Though Scout's mother died when she was a baby, Lee was 25 when her mother, Frances Cunningham Finch, died. Lee's mother was prone to a nervous condition that rendered her mentally and emotionally absent.Shields, pp. 40\\u201341. Lee's older brother Edwin was the inspiration for Jem.\\n\\nLee modeled the character of Dill on Truman Capote, her childhood friend known then as Truman Persons.Krebs, Albin. \\\"Truman Capote Is Dead at 59; Novelist of Style and Clarity\\\", The New York Times, August 26, 1984, p.\\u00a01. Just as Dill lived next door to Scout during the summer, Capote lived next door to Lee with his aunts while his mother visited New York City.Fleming, Anne Taylor (July 9, 1976). \\\"The Private World of Truman Capote\\\", The New York Times Magazine. p. SM6. Like Dill, Capote had an impressive imagination and a gift for fascinating stories. Both Lee and Capote loved to read, and were atypical children in some ways: Lee was a scrappy tomboy who was quick to fight, and Capote was ridiculed for his advanced vocabulary and lisp. She and Capote made up and acted out stories they wrote on an old Underwood typewriter that Lee's father gave them. They became good friends when both felt alienated from their peers; Capote called the two of them \\\"apart people\\\".Steinem, Gloria (November 1967). \\\"Go Right Ahead and Ask Me Anything (And So She Did): An Interview with Truman Capote\\\", McCall's, p. 76. In 1960, Capote and Lee traveled to Kansas together to investigate the multiple murders that were the basis for Capote's nonfiction novel In Cold Blood.\\n\\nDown the street from the Lees lived a family whose house was always boarded up; they served as the models for the fictional Radleys. The son of the family got into some legal trouble and the father kept him at home for 24\\u00a0years out of shame. He was hidden until virtually forgotten; he died in 1952.Hile, Kevin S. \\\"Harper Lee\\\" in Authors and Artists for Young Adults, Gale Research 13 (August 1994) \\n\\nThe origin of Tom Robinson is less clear, although many have speculated that his character was inspired by several models. When Lee was 10\\u00a0years old, a white woman near Monroeville accused a black man named Walter Lett of raping her. The story and the trial were covered by her father's newspaper, which reported that Lett was convicted and sentenced to death. After a series of letters appeared claiming Lett had been falsely accused, his sentence was commuted to life in prison. He died there of tuberculosis in 1937.Bigg, Matthew (July 23, 2007). \\\"Novel Still Stirs Pride, Debate; 'Mockingbird' Draws Tourists to Town Coming to Grips With Its Past, The Washington Post, p. A3. Scholars believe that Robinson's difficulties reflect the notorious case of the Scottsboro Boys,Johnson, Boundaries, pp. 7\\u201311.Noble, p. 13. in which nine black men were convicted of raping two white women on negligible evidence. However, in 2005, Lee stated that she had in mind something less sensational, although the Scottsboro case served \\\"the same purpose\\\" to display Southern prejudices.Shields, p. 118. Emmett Till, a black teenager who was murdered for allegedly flirting with a white woman in Mississippi in 1955, and whose death is credited as a catalyst for the Civil Rights Movement, is also considered a model for Tom.Chura, Patrick (Spring 2000). \\\"Prolepsis and Anachronism: Emmett Till and the Historicity of To Kill a Mockingbird\\\", Southern Literary Journal 32 (2), p. 1.\\n\\n Style \\n\\nThe strongest element of style noted by critics and reviewers is Lee's talent for narration, which in an early review in Time was called \\\"tactile brilliance\\\". Writing a decade later, another scholar noted, \\\"Harper Lee has a remarkable gift of story-telling. Her art is visual, and with cinematographic fluidity and subtlety we see a scene melting into another scene without jolts of transition.\\\" Lee combines the narrator's voice of a child observing her surroundings with a grown woman's reflecting on her childhood, using the ambiguity of this voice combined with the narrative technique of flashback to play intricately with perspectives.Graeme Dunphy, \\\"Meena's Mockingbird: From Harper Lee to Meera Syal\\\", Neophilologus, 88 (2004) 637\\u2013660. PDF online This narrative method allows Lee to tell a \\\"delightfully deceptive\\\" story that mixes the simplicity of childhood observation with adult situations complicated by hidden motivations and unquestioned tradition.Ward, L. \\\"To Kill a Mockingbird (book review).\\\" Commonwealth: December 9, 1960. However, at times the blending causes reviewers to question Scout's preternatural vocabulary and depth of understanding. Both Harding LeMay and the novelist and literary critic Granville Hicks expressed doubt that children as sheltered as Scout and Jem could understand the complexities and horrors involved in the trial for Tom Robinson's life.LeMay, Harding (July 10, 1960). \\\"Children Play; Adults Betray\\\", New York Herald Tribune.Hicks, Granville (July 23, 1970). \\\"Three at the Outset\\\", Saturday Review, 30.\\n\\nWriting about Lee's style and use of humor in a tragic story, scholar Jacqueline Tavernier-Courbin states: \\\"Laughter\\u00a0... [exposes] the gangrene under the beautiful surface but also by demeaning it; one can hardly\\u00a0... be controlled by what one is able to laugh at.\\\"Tavernier-Courbin, Jacqueline \\\"Humor and Humanity in To Kill a Mockingbird\\\" in On Harper Lee: Essays and Reflections Alice Petry (ed.), University of Tennessee Press (2007). .  Scout's precocious observations about her neighbors and behavior inspired National Endowment of the Arts director David Kipen to call her \\\"hysterically funny\\\".Murphy, p. 105. To address complex issues, however, Tavernier-Courbin notes that Lee uses parody, satire, and irony effectively by using a child's perspective. After Dill promises to marry her, then spends too much time with Jem, Scout reasons the best way to get him to pay attention to her is to beat him up, which she does several times.Lee, p. 46. Scout's first day in school is a satirical treatment of education; her teacher says she must undo the damage Atticus has wrought in teaching her to read and write, and forbids Atticus from teaching her further.Lee, p. 19. Lee treats the most unfunny situations with irony, however, as Jem and Scout try to understand how Maycomb embraces racism and still tries sincerely to remain a decent society.  Satire and irony are used to such an extent that Tavernier-Courbin suggests one interpretation for the book's title: Lee is doing the mocking\\u2014of education, the justice system, and her own society\\u2014by using them as subjects of her humorous disapproval.\\n\\nCritics also note the entertaining methods used to drive the plot.Boerman-Cornell, William \\\"The Five Humors\\\", The English Journal (1999), 88 (4), p. 66.  When Atticus is out of town, Jem locks a Sunday school classmate in the church basement with the furnace during a game of Shadrach. This prompts their black housekeeper Calpurnia to escort Scout and Jem to her church, which allows the children a glimpse into her personal life, as well as Tom Robinson's.Lee, p. 133. Scout falls asleep during the Halloween pageant and makes a tardy entrance onstage, causing the audience to laugh uproariously. She is so distracted and embarrassed that she prefers to go home in her ham costume, which saves her life.Lee, p. 297.\\n\\n Genres \\nScholars have characterized To Kill a Mockingbird as both a Southern Gothic and a Bildungsroman. The grotesque and near-supernatural qualities of Boo Radley and his house, and the element of racial injustice involving Tom Robinson, contribute to the aura of the Gothic in the novel.Johnson, Boundaries, pp. 40\\u201341. Lee used the term \\\"Gothic\\\" to describe the architecture of Maycomb's courthouse and in regard to Dill's exaggeratedly morbid performances as Boo Radley.Johnson, Boundaries pp. 39\\u201345. Outsiders are also an important element of Southern Gothic texts and Scout and Jem's questions about the hierarchy in the town cause scholars to compare the novel to Catcher in the Rye and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.Murphy, pp. x, 96, 149. Despite challenging the town's systems, Scout reveres Atticus as an authority above all others, because he believes that following one's conscience is the highest priority, even when the result is social ostracism.Fine, Laura \\\"Structuring the Narrator's Rebellion in To Kill a Mockingbird\\\" in On Harper Lee: Essays and Reflections Alice Petry (ed.), University of Tennessee Press (2007).  However, scholars debate about the Southern Gothic classification, noting that Boo Radley is in fact human, protective, and benevolent. Furthermore, in addressing themes such as alcoholism, incest, rape, and racial violence, Lee wrote about her small town realistically rather than melodramatically. She portrays the problems of individual characters as universal underlying issues in every society.\\n\\nAs children coming of age, Scout and Jem face hard realities and learn from them. Lee seems to examine Jem's sense of loss about how his neighbors have disappointed him more than Scout's. Jem says to their neighbor Miss Maudie the day after the trial, \\\"It's like bein' a caterpillar wrapped in a cocoon\\u00a0... I always thought Maycomb folks were the best folks in the world, least that's what they seemed like\\\".Lee, p. 246. This leads him to struggle with understanding the separations of race and class. Just as the novel is an illustration of the changes Jem faces, it is also an exploration of the realities Scout must face as an atypical girl on the verge of womanhood. As one scholar writes, \\\"To Kill a Mockingbird can be read as a feminist Bildungsroman, for Scout emerges from her childhood experiences with a clear sense of her place in her community and an awareness of her potential power as the woman she will one day be.\\\"\\n\\n Themes \\nDespite the novel's immense popularity upon publication, it has not received the close critical attention paid to other modern American classics. Don Noble, editor of a book of essays about the novel, estimates that the ratio of sales to analytical essays may be a million to one. Christopher Metress writes that the book is \\\"an icon whose emotive sway remains strangely powerful because it also remains unexamined\\\". Noble suggests it does not receive academic attention because of its consistent status as a best-seller (\\\"If that many people like it, it can't be any good.\\\") and that general readers seem to feel they do not require analytical interpretation.Noble, pp. vii\\u2013viii.\\n\\nHarper Lee had remained famously detached from interpreting the novel since the mid-1960s. However, she gave some insight into her themes when, in a rare letter to the editor, she wrote in response to the passionate reaction her book caused:Surely it is plain to the simplest intelligence that To Kill a Mockingbird spells out in words of seldom more than two syllables a code of honor and conduct, Christian in its ethic, that is the heritage of all Southerners.\\\"\\\"Harper Lee Twits School Board In Virginia for Ban on Her Novel\\\", The New York Times (January 6, 1966), p. 82\\n\\n Southern life and racial injustice \\n\\nWhen the book was released, reviewers noted that it was divided into two parts, and opinion was mixed about Lee's ability to connect them.Johnson, Boundaries pp. 20\\u201324  The first part of the novel concerns the children's fascination with Boo Radley and their feelings of safety and comfort in the neighborhood.  Reviewers were generally charmed by Scout and Jem's observations of their quirky neighbors.  One writer was so impressed by Lee's detailed explanations of the people of Maycomb that he categorized the book as Southern romantic regionalism.Erisman, Fred (April 1973). \\\"The Romantic Regionalism of Harper Lee\\\", The Alabama Review, 27 (2).  This sentimentalism can be seen in Lee's representation of the Southern caste system to explain almost every character's behavior in the novel. Scout's Aunt Alexandra attributes Maycomb's inhabitants' faults and advantages to genealogy (families that have gambling streaks and drinking streaks),Bruell, Edwin (December 1964). \\\"Keen Scalpel on Racial Ills\\\", The English Journal 51 (9) pp. 658\\u2013661. and the narrator sets the action and characters amid a finely detailed background of the Finch family history and the history of Maycomb.  This regionalist theme is further reflected in Mayella Ewell's apparent powerlessness to admit her advances toward Tom Robinson, and Scout's definition of \\\"fine folks\\\" being people with good sense who do the best they can with what they have.  The South itself, with its traditions and taboos, seems to drive the plot more than the characters.\\n\\nThe second part of the novel deals with what book reviewer Harding LeMay termed \\\"the spirit-corroding shame of the civilized white Southerner in the treatment of the Negro\\\". In the years following its release, many reviewers considered To Kill a Mockingbird a novel primarily concerned with race relations.Henderson, R. (May 15, 1960). \\\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\\", Library Journal. Claudia Durst Johnson considers it \\\"reasonable to believe\\\" that the novel was shaped by two events involving racial issues in Alabama: Rosa Parks' refusal to yield her seat on a city bus to a white person, which sparked the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott, and the 1956 riots at the University of Alabama after Autherine Lucy and Polly Myers were admitted (Myers eventually withdrew her application and Lucy was expelled, but reinstated in 1980).Johnson, Claudia (Autumn 1991). \\\"The Secret Courts of Men's Hearts\\\", Studies in American Fiction 19 (2). In writing about the historical context of the novel's construction, two other literary scholars remark: \\\"To Kill a Mockingbird was written and published amidst the most significant and conflict-ridden social change in the South since the Civil War and Reconstruction. Inevitably, despite its mid-1930s setting, the story told from the perspective of the 1950s voices the conflicts, tensions, and fears induced by this transition.\\\"\\n\\nScholar Patrick Chura, who suggests Emmett Till was a model for Tom Robinson, enumerates the injustices endured by the fictional Tom that Till also faced. Chura notes the icon of the black rapist causing harm to the representation of the \\\"mythologized vulnerable and sacred Southern womanhood\\\". Any transgressions by black males that merely hinted at sexual contact with white females during the time the novel was set often resulted in a punishment of death for the accused. Tom Robinson's trial was juried by poor white farmers who convicted him despite overwhelming evidence of his innocence, as more educated and moderate white townspeople supported the jury's decision. Furthermore, the victim of racial injustice in To Kill a Mockingbird was physically impaired, which made him unable to commit the act he was accused of, but also crippled him in other ways. Roslyn Siegel includes Tom Robinson as an example of the recurring motif among white Southern writers of the black man as \\\"stupid, pathetic, defenseless, and dependent upon the fair dealing of the whites, rather than his own intelligence to save him\\\".Siegel, Roslyn \\\"The Black Man and the Macabre in American Literature\\\", Black American Literature Forum (1976), 10 (4), p. 133.  Although Tom is spared from being lynched, he is killed with excessive violence during an attempted escape from prison, being shot seventeen times.\\n\\nThe theme of racial injustice appears symbolically in the novel as well. For example, Atticus must shoot a rabid dog, even though it is not his job to do so.Lee, pp. 107\\u2013113. Carolyn Jones argues that the dog represents prejudice within the town of Maycomb, and Atticus, who waits on a deserted street to shoot the dog,Jones, Carolyn (Summer 1996). \\\"Atticus Finch and the Mad Dog\\\" Southern Quarterly: A Journal of the Arts in the South, 34 (4), pp. 53\\u201363. must fight against the town's racism without help from other white citizens. He is also alone when he faces a group intending to lynch Tom Robinson and once more in the courthouse during Tom's trial. Lee even uses dreamlike imagery from the mad dog incident to describe some of the courtroom scenes. Jones writes, \\\"[t]he real mad dog in Maycomb is the racism that denies the humanity of Tom Robinson\\u00a0.... When Atticus makes his summation to the jury, he literally bares himself to the jury's and the town's anger.\\\"\\n\\n Class \\n\\nIn a 1964 interview, Lee remarked that her aspiration was \\\"to be\\u00a0... the Jane Austen of South Alabama.\\\"Blackall, Jean \\\"Valorizing the Commonplace: Harper Lee's Response to Jane Austen\\\" in On Harper Lee: Essays and Reflections Alice Petry (ed.). University of Tennessee Press (2007).  Both Austen and Lee challenged the social status quo and valued individual worth over social standing. When Scout embarrasses her poorer classmate, Walter Cunningham, at the Finch home one day, Calpurnia, their black cook, chastises and punishes her for doing so.Lee, p. 27. Atticus respects Calpurnia's judgment, and later in the book even stands up to his sister, the formidable Aunt Alexandra, when she strongly suggests they fire Calpurnia.Lee, p. 155. One writer notes that Scout, \\\"in Austenian fashion\\\", satirizes women with whom she does not wish to identify. Literary critic Jean Blackall lists the priorities shared by the two authors: \\\"affirmation of order in society, obedience, courtesy, and respect for the individual without regard for status\\\".\\n\\nScholars argue that Lee's approach to class and race was more complex \\\"than ascribing racial prejudice primarily to 'poor white trash'\\u00a0... Lee demonstrates how issues of gender and class intensify prejudice, silence the voices that might challenge the existing order, and greatly complicate many Americans' conception of the causes of racism and segregation.\\\"Hovet, Theodore and Grace-Ann (Fall 2001). \\\"'Fine Fancy Gentlemen' and 'Yappy Folk': Contending Voices in To Kill a Mockingbird\\\", Southern Quarterly: A Journal of the Arts in the South, 40 pp. 67\\u201378.  Lee's use of the middle-class narrative voice is a literary device that allows an intimacy with the reader, regardless of class or cultural background, and fosters a sense of nostalgia.  Sharing Scout and Jem's perspective, the reader is allowed to engage in relationships with the conservative antebellum Mrs. Dubose; the lower-class Ewells, and the Cunninghams who are equally poor but behave in vastly different ways; the wealthy but ostracized Mr. Dolphus Raymond; and Calpurnia and other members of the black community.  The children internalize Atticus' admonition not to judge someone until they have walked around in that person's skin, gaining a greater understanding of people's motives and behavior.\\n\\n Courage and compassion \\nThe novel has been noted for its poignant exploration of different forms of courage.\\\"Nelle Harper Lee.\\\" Contemporary Authors Online, Gale, 2007.Jolley, Susan \\\"Integrating Poetry and 'To Kill a Mockingbird'\\\", The English Journal (2002), 92 (2), p. 34.  Scout's impulsive inclination to fight students who insult Atticus reflects her attempt to stand up for him and defend him.  Atticus is the moral center of the novel, however, and he teaches Jem one of the most significant lessons of courage.Mancini, p. 19.  In a statement that both foreshadows Atticus' motivation for defending Tom Robinson and describes Mrs. Dubose, who is determined to break herself of a morphine addiction, Atticus tells Jem that courage is \\\"when you're licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what\\\".Lee, p. 128.\\n\\nCharles J. Shields, who wrote the first book-length biography of Harper Lee, offers the reason for the novel's enduring popularity and impact is that \\\"its lessons of human dignity and respect for others remain fundamental and universal\\\".Shields, p.\\u00a01.  Atticus' lesson to Scout that \\\"you never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view\\u2014until you climb around in his skin and walk around in it\\\" exemplifies his compassion.Lee, p. 33.  She ponders the comment when listening to Mayella Ewell's testimony.  When Mayella reacts with confusion to Atticus' question if she has any friends, Scout offers that she must be lonelier than Boo Radley.  Having walked Boo home after he saves their lives, Scout stands on the Radley porch and considers the events of the previous three years from Boo's perspective.  One writer remarks, \\\"...\\u00a0[w]hile the novel concerns tragedy and injustice, heartache and loss, it also carries with it a strong sense [of] courage, compassion, and an awareness of history to be better human beings.\\\"\\n\\n Gender roles \\nJust as Lee explores Jem's development in coming to grips with a racist and unjust society, Scout realizes what being female means, and several female characters influence her development.  Scout's primary identification with her father and older brother allows her to describe the variety and depth of female characters in the novel both as one of them and as an outsider.Ware, Michele \\\"'Just a Lady': Gender and Power in Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird\\\" in Women in Literature: Reading Through the Lens of Gender Jerilyn Fisher and Ellen S. Silber (eds.), Greenwood Press (2003). .  Scout's primary female models are Calpurnia and her neighbor Miss Maudie, both of whom are strong-willed, independent, and protective.  Mayella Ewell also has an influence; Scout watches her destroy an innocent man in order to hide her desire for him.  The female characters who comment the most on Scout's lack of willingness to adhere to a more feminine role are also those who promote the most racist and classist points of view.Shackelford, Dean (Winter 1996\\u20131997). \\\"The Female Voice in To Kill a Mockingbird: Narrative Strategies in Film and Novel\\\", Mississippi Quarterly: The Journal of Southern Cultures, 50 (1), pp. 101\\u201313.  For example, Mrs. Dubose chastises Scout for not wearing a dress and camisole, and indicates she is ruining the family name by not doing so, in addition to insulting Atticus' intentions to defend Tom Robinson.  By balancing the masculine influences of Atticus and Jem with the feminine influences of Calpurnia and Miss Maudie, one scholar writes, \\\"Lee gradually demonstrates that Scout is becoming a feminist in the South, for with the use of first-person narration, she indicates that Scout/ Jean Louise still maintains the ambivalence about being a Southern lady she possessed as a child.\\\"\\n\\nAbsent mothers and abusive fathers are another theme in the novel. Scout and Jem's mother died before Scout could remember her, Mayella's mother is dead, and Mrs. Radley is silent about Boo's confinement to the house. Apart from Atticus, the fathers described are abusers.Fine, Laura (Summer 1998). \\\"Gender Conflicts and Their 'Dark' Projections in Coming of Age White Female Southern Novels\\\", Southern Quarterly: A Journal of the Arts in the South 36 (4), pp. 121\\u201329 Bob Ewell, it is hinted, molested his daughter, and Mr. Radley imprisons his son in his house to the extent that Boo is remembered only as a phantom. Bob Ewell and Mr. Radley represent a form of masculinity that Atticus does not, and the novel suggests that such men, as well as the traditionally feminine hypocrites at the Missionary Society, can lead society astray. Atticus stands apart as a unique model of masculinity; as one scholar explains: \\\"It is the job of real men who embody the traditional masculine qualities of heroic individualism, bravery, and an unshrinking knowledge of and dedication to social justice and morality, to set the society straight.\\\"\\n\\n Laws, written and unwritten \\nAllusions to legal issues in To Kill a Mockingbird, particularly in scenes outside of the courtroom, have drawn the attention of legal scholars. Claudia Durst Johnson writes that \\\"a greater volume of critical readings has been amassed by two legal scholars in law journals than by all the literary scholars in literary journals\\\".Johnson, Boundaries pp. 25\\u201327. The opening quote by the 19th-century essayist Charles Lamb reads: \\\"Lawyers, I suppose, were children once.\\\" Johnson notes that even in Scout and Jem's childhood world, compromises and treaties are struck with each other by spitting on one's palm, and laws are discussed by Atticus and his children: is it right that Bob Ewell hunts and traps out of season? Many social codes are broken by people in symbolic courtrooms: Mr. Dolphus Raymond has been exiled by society for taking a black woman as his common-law wife and having interracial children; Mayella Ewell is beaten by her father in punishment for kissing Tom Robinson; by being turned into a non-person, Boo Radley receives a punishment far greater than any court could have given him. Scout repeatedly breaks codes and laws and reacts to her punishment for them. For example, she refuses to wear frilly clothes, saying that Aunt Alexandra's \\\"fanatical\\\" attempts to place her in them made her feel \\\"a pink cotton penitentiary closing in on [her]\\\".Lee, p. 146. Johnson states, \\\"[t]he novel is a study of how Jem and Scout begin to perceive the complexity of social codes and how the configuration of relationships dictated by or set off by those codes fails or nurtures the inhabitants of (their) small worlds.\\\"\\n\\n Loss of innocence \\nthumb|upright|alt=A color photograph of a northern mockingbird|Lee used the mockingbird to symbolize innocence in the novel\\nSongbirds and their associated symbolism appear throughout the novel. Their family name Finch is also Lee's mother's maiden name. The titular mockingbird is a key motif of this theme, which first appears when Atticus, having given his children air-rifles for Christmas, allows their Uncle Jack to teach them to shoot. Atticus warns them that, although they can \\\"shoot all the bluejays they want\\\", they must remember that \\\"it's a sin to kill a mockingbird\\\".Lee, p. 103. Confused, Scout approaches her neighbor Miss Maudie, who explains that mockingbirds never harm other living creatures. She points out that mockingbirds simply provide pleasure with their songs, saying, \\\"They don't do one thing but sing their hearts out for us.\\\" Writer Edwin Bruell summarized the symbolism when he wrote in 1964, \\\"'To kill a mockingbird' is to kill that which is innocent and harmless\\u2014like Tom Robinson.\\\" Scholars have noted that Lee often returns to the mockingbird theme when trying to make a moral point.Schuster, Edgar \\\"Discovering Theme and Structure in the Novel\\\" The English Journal (1963), 52 (7) p. 506. Johnson, Casebook p. 207.\\n\\nTom Robinson is the chief example, among several in the novel, of innocents being carelessly or deliberately destroyed.  However, scholar Christopher Metress connects the mockingbird to Boo Radley: \\\"Instead of wanting to exploit Boo for her own fun (as she does in the beginning of the novel by putting on gothic plays about his history), Scout comes to see him as a 'mockingbird'\\u2014that is, as someone with an inner goodness that must be cherished.\\\"Metress, Christopher. \\\"Lee, Harper.\\\" Contemporary Southern Writers. St. James Press, 1999. The last pages of the book illustrate this as Scout relates the moral of a story Atticus has been reading to her, and, in allusions to both Boo Radley and Tom Robinson, states about a character who was misunderstood, \\\"when they finally saw him, why he hadn't done any of those things\\u00a0... Atticus, he was real nice,\\\" to which he responds, \\\"Most people are, Scout, when you finally see them.\\\"Lee, p.\\u00a0322\\u2013323.\\n\\nThe novel exposes the loss of innocence so frequently that reviewer R. A. Dave claims that because every character has to face, or even suffer defeat, the book takes on elements of a classical tragedy.Dave, R.A. (1974). \\\"Harper Lee's Tragic Vision\\\" Indian Studies in American Fiction MacMillan Company of India, Ltd.  pp. 311\\u2013323.  In exploring how each character deals with his or her own personal defeat, Lee builds a framework to judge whether the characters are heroes or fools. She guides the reader in such judgments, alternating between unabashed adoration and biting irony. Scout's experience with the Missionary Society is an ironic juxtaposition of women who mock her, gossip, and \\\"reflect a smug, colonialist attitude toward other races\\\" while giving the \\\"appearance of gentility, piety, and morality\\\". Conversely, when Atticus loses Tom's case, he is last to leave the courtroom, except for his children and the black spectators in the colored balcony, who rise silently as he walks underneath them, to honor his efforts.Lee, p.\\u00a0241.\\n\\n Reception \\nDespite her editors' warnings that the book might not sell well, it quickly became a sensation, bringing acclaim to Lee in literary circles, in her hometown of Monroeville, and throughout Alabama.Shields, pp. 185\\u2013188.

Following parental complaints about the racist language it contains, the novel was removed from classrooms in Virginia in 2016 and Biloxi in 2017, where it was described as making people \\\"uncomfortable\\\". In the Mississippi case, the novel was removed from the required reading list but subsequently made available to interested students with parental consent. Such decisions have been criticised: the American Civil Liberties Union noted the importance of engaging with the novel's themes in places where racial injustice persists. Becky Little of The History Channel and representatives of the Mark Twain House pointed out the value of classics lies in their power to \\\"challenge the way we think about things\\\" (Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn has attracted similar controversy). Arne Duncan, who served as Secretary of Education under President Obama, noted that removal of the book from reading lists was evidence of a nation with \\\"real problems\\\". In 1966, a parent in Hanover, Virginia protested that the use of rape as a plot device was immoral. Johnson cites examples of letters to local newspapers, which ranged from amusement to fury; those letters expressing the most outrage, however, complained about Mayella Ewell's attraction to Tom Robinson over the depictions of rape.Johnson, Casebook pp. 208\\u2013213.

This draft, which was completed in 1957, is set 20 years after the time period depicted in To Kill a Mockingbird but is not a continuation of the narrative. This earlier version of the story follows an adult Scout Finch who travels from New York City to visit her father, Atticus Finch, in Maycomb, Alabama, where she is confronted by the intolerance in her community. The Watchman manuscript was believed to have been lost until Lee's lawyer Tonja Carter discovered it, but this claim has been widely disputed. Watchman contains early versions of many of the characters from To Kill a Mockingbird. According to Lee's agent Andrew Nurnberg, Mockingbird was originally intended to be the first book of a trilogy: \\\"They discussed publishing Mockingbird first, Watchman last, and a shorter connecting novel between the two.\\\" This assertion has been discredited, however, by rare-books expert James S. Jaffe, who reviewed the pages at the request of Lee's attorney and found them to be only another draft of To Kill a Mockingbird.

I've had many, many offers to turn it into musicals, into TV or stage plays, but I've always refused. That film was a work of art\\\".Jones, Carolyn \\\"Harper Lee\\\", in The History of Southern Women's Literature, Carolyn Perry (ed.): Louisiana State University Press (2002).  Peck met Lee's father, the model for Atticus, before the filming. Lee's father died before the film's release. Lee was so impressed with Peck's performance that she gave him her father's pocket watch, which he had with him the evening he was awarded the Oscar for Best Actor.Bobbin, Jay (December 21, 1997). \\\"Gregory Peck is Atticus Finch in Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird\\\", The Birmingham News (Alabama), p. 1.F Years later, he was reluctant to tell Lee that the watch was stolen out of his luggage in London Heathrow Airport.

It debuted in 1990 in Monroeville, a town that labels itself \\\"The Literary Capital of Alabama\\\". The play runs every May on the county courthouse grounds and townspeople make up the cast. White male audience members are chosen at the intermission to make up the jury. During the courtroom scene the production moves into the Monroe County Courthouse and the audience is racially segregated.Noble, pp. 4\\u20135. Author Albert Murray said of the relationship of the town to the novel (and the annual performance): \\\"It becomes part of the town ritual, like the religious underpinning of Mardi Gras. With the whole town crowded around the actual courthouse, it's part of a central, civic education\\u2014what Monroeville aspires to be.\\\"Hoffman, Roy (August 9, 1998). \\\"Long Lives the Mockingbird\\\", The New York Times Book Review, p.  31.\\n\\nSergel's play toured in the UK starting at West Yorkshire Playhouse in Leeds in 2006, and again in 2011 starting at the York Theatre Royal, both productions featuring Duncan Preston as Atticus Finch. The play also opened the 2013 season at Regent's Park Open Air Theatre in London where it played to full houses and starred Robert Sean Leonard as Atticus Finch, his first London appearance in 22 years. The production returned to the venue to close the 2014 season, prior to a UK tour.\\n\\nAccording to a National Geographic article, the novel is so revered in Monroeville that people quote lines from it like Scripture; yet Harper Lee herself refused to attend any performances, because \\\"she abhors anything that trades on the book's fame\\\".Newman, Cathy (January 2006).
