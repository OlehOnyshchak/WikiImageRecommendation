Collins English Dictionary. 2 June 1857 \\u2013 23 February 1934) was an English composer, many of whose works have entered the British and international classical concert repertoire. Among his best-known compositions are orchestral works including the Enigma Variations, the Pomp and Circumstance Marches, concertos for violin and cello, and two symphonies. He also composed choral works, including The Dream of Gerontius, chamber music and songs. He was appointed Master of the King's Musick in 1924.\\n\\nAlthough Elgar is often regarded as a typically English composer, most of his musical influences were not from England but from continental Europe. He felt himself to be an outsider, not only musically, but socially. In musical circles dominated by academics, he was a self-taught composer; in Protestant Britain, his Roman Catholicism was regarded with suspicion in some quarters; and in the class-conscious society of Victorian and Edwardian Britain, he was acutely sensitive about his humble origins even after he achieved recognition. He nevertheless married the daughter of a senior British army officer. She inspired him both musically and socially, but he struggled to achieve success until his forties, when after a series of moderately successful works his Enigma Variations (1899) became immediately popular in Britain and overseas. He followed the Variations with a choral work, The Dream of Gerontius (1900), based on a Roman Catholic text that caused some disquiet in the Anglican establishment in Britain, but it became, and has remained, a core repertory work in Britain and elsewhere. His later full-length religious choral works were well received but have not entered the regular repertory.\\n\\nIn his fifties, Elgar composed a symphony and a violin concerto that were immensely successful. His second symphony and his cello concerto did not gain immediate public popularity and took many years to achieve a regular place in the concert repertory of British orchestras. Elgar's music came, in his later years, to be seen as appealing chiefly to British audiences. His stock remained low for a generation after his death. It began to revive significantly in the 1960s, helped by new recordings of his works. Some of his works have, in recent years, been taken up again internationally, but the music continues to be played more in Britain than elsewhere.\\n\\nElgar has been described as the first composer to take the gramophone seriously. Between 1914 and 1925, he conducted a series of acoustic recordings of his works. The introduction of the moving-coil microphone in 1923 made far more accurate sound reproduction possible, and Elgar made new recordings of most of his major orchestral works and excerpts from The Dream of Gerontius.\\n\\nBiography\\nthumb|alt=a brick country cottage with a large front garden|Elgar's birthplace, The Firs, Lower Broadheath\\n\\nEarly years\\nEdward Elgar was born in the small village of Lower Broadheath, outside Worcester, England. His father, William Henry Elgar (1821\\u20131906), was raised in Dover and had been apprenticed to a London music publisher. In 1841 William moved to Worcester, where he worked as a piano tuner and set up a shop selling sheet music and musical instruments. In 1848 he married Ann Greening (1822\\u20131902), daughter of a farm worker.McVeagh, Diana, \\\"Elgar, Edward\\\". Grove Music Online. Retrieved 20 April 2010  Edward was the fourth of their seven children. Ann Elgar had converted to Roman Catholicism shortly before Edward's birth, and he was baptised and brought up as a Roman Catholic, to the disapproval of his father. William Elgar was a violinist of professional standard and held the post of organist of St. George's Roman Catholic Church, Worcester, from 1846 to 1885. At his instigation, masses by Cherubini and Hummel were first heard at the Three Choirs Festival by the orchestra in which he played the violin.\\\"Edward Elgar\\\", The Musical Times, 1 October 1900, pp. 641\\u201348 All the Elgar children received a musical upbringing. By the age of eight, Elgar was taking piano and violin lessons, and his father, who tuned the pianos at many grand houses in Worcestershire, would sometimes take him along, giving him the chance to display his skill to important local figures.\\n\\nthumb|left|alt=images of an elderly man in Victorian costume, seen in right profile, and of an elderly woman also in Victorian clothing, smiling towards the camera|Elgar's parents, William and Ann Elgar\\nElgar's mother was interested in the arts and encouraged his musical development. He inherited from her a discerning taste for literature and a passionate love of the countryside.Moore (1984), p. 11 and Kennedy (ODNB) His friend and biographer W. H. \\\"Billy\\\" Reed wrote that Elgar's early surroundings had an influence that \\\"permeated all his work and gave to his whole life that subtle but none the less true and sturdy English quality\\\".Reed, p. 1 He began composing at an early age; for a play written and acted by the Elgar children when he was about ten, he wrote music that forty years later he rearranged with only minor changes and orchestrated as the suites titled The Wand of Youth.\\n\\nUntil he was fifteen, Elgar received a general education at Littleton (now Lyttleton) House school, near Worcester. However, his only formal musical training beyond piano and violin lessons from local teachers consisted of more advanced violin studies with Adolf Pollitzer, during brief visits to London in 1877\\u201378. Elgar said, \\\"my first music was learnt in the Cathedral\\u00a0... from books borrowed from the music library, when I was eight, nine or ten.\\\"Quoted by Kennedy (ODNB) He worked through manuals of instruction on organ playing and read every book he could find on the theory of music. He later said that he had been most helped by Hubert Parry's articles in the Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians.Reed, p. 11 Elgar began to learn German, in the hope of going to the Leipzig Conservatory for further musical studies, but his father could not afford to send him. Years later, a profile in The Musical Times considered that his failure to get to Leipzig was fortunate for Elgar's musical development: \\\"Thus the budding composer escaped the dogmatism of the schools.\\\" However, it was a disappointment to Elgar that on leaving school in 1872 he went not to Leipzig but to the office of a local solicitor as a clerk. He did not find an office career congenial, and for fulfilment he turned not only to music but to literature, becoming a voracious reader. Around this time, he made his first public appearances as a violinist and organist.Moore (1984), pp. 57 and 67\\n\\nAfter a few months, Elgar left the solicitor to embark on a musical career, giving piano and violin lessons and working occasionally in his father's shop. He was an active member of the Worcester Glee club, along with his father, and he accompanied singers, played the violin, composed and arranged works, and conducted for the first time. Pollitzer believed that, as a violinist, Elgar had the potential to be one of the leading soloists in the country,\\\"Edward Elgar\\\", The Guardian, 24 February 1934, p. 16 but Elgar himself, having heard leading virtuosi at London concerts, felt his own violin playing lacked a full enough tone, and he abandoned his ambitions to be a soloist. At twenty-two he took up the post of conductor of the attendants' band at the Worcester and County Lunatic Asylum in Powick,  from Worcester. The band consisted of: piccolo, flute, clarinet, two cornets, euphonium, three or four first and a similar number of second violins, occasional viola, cello, double bass and piano.Young (1973), p. 47 Elgar coached the players and wrote and arranged their music, including quadrilles and polkas, for the unusual combination of instruments. The Musical Times wrote, \\\"This practical experience proved to be of the greatest value to the young musician.\\u00a0... He acquired a practical knowledge of the capabilities of these different instruments.\\u00a0... He thereby got to know intimately the tone colour, the ins and outs of these and many other instruments.\\\" He held the post for five years, from 1879, travelling to Powick once a week. Another post he held in his early days was professor of the violin at the Worcester College for the Blind Sons of Gentlemen.\\n\\nAlthough rather solitary and introspective by nature, Elgar thrived in Worcester's musical circles. He played in the violins at the Worcester and Birmingham Festivals, and one great experience was to play Dvo\\u0159\\u00e1k's Symphony No. 6 and Stabat Mater under the composer's baton.Maine, Basil, \\\"Elgar, Sir Edward William\\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography archive, Oxford University Press, 1949. Retrieved 20 April 2010 . Elgar regularly played the bassoon in a wind quintet, alongside his brother Frank, an oboist (and conductor who ran his own wind band). Elgar arranged numerous pieces by Mozart, Beethoven, Haydn, and others for the quintet, honing his arranging and compositional skills.\\n\\nthumb|left|alt=composite image of four head and shoulders images of nineteenth century men.

He heard Saint-Sa\\u00ebns play the organ at the Madeleine and attended concerts by first-rate orchestras. In 1882 he wrote, \\\"I got pretty well dosed with Schumann (my ideal!), Brahms, Rubinstein & Wagner, so had no cause to complain.\\\" In Leipzig he visited a friend, Helen Weaver, who was a student at the Conservatoire. They became engaged in the summer of 1883, but for unknown reasons the engagement was broken off the next year. Elgar was greatly distressed, and some of his later cryptic dedications of romantic music may have alluded to Helen and his feelings for her. Throughout his life, Elgar was often inspired by close women friends; Helen Weaver was succeeded by Mary Lygon, Dora Penny, Julia Worthington, Alice Stuart Wortley and finally Vera Hockman, who enlivened his old age.Moore (1984), pp. 96, 264, 348, 512, 574, and 811\\n\\nIn 1882, seeking more professional orchestral experience, Elgar was employed to play violin in Birmingham with William Stockley's Orchestra,Moore (1984), pp. 95\\u201396 for whom he would play every concert for the next seven yearsYoung (1995), p. 87 and where he later claimed he \\\"learned all the music I know\\\".Moore (1984), p. 325 On 13 December 1883 he took part with Stockley in a performance at Birmingham Town Hall of one of his first works for full orchestra, the S\\u00e9r\\u00e9nade mauresque \\u2013 the first time one of his compositions had been performed by a professional orchestra. Stockley had invited him to conduct the piece but later recalled \\\"he declined, and, further, insisted upon playing in his place in the orchestra. The consequence was that he had to appear, fiddle in hand, to acknowledge the genuine and hearty applause of the audience.\\\"Quoted in \\\"Edward Elgar\\\", The Musical Times, 1 October 1900, pp. 641\\u201348 Elgar often went to London in an attempt to get his works published, but this period in his life found him frequently despondent and low on money. He wrote to a friend in April 1884, \\\"My prospects are about as hopeless as ever\\u00a0... I am not wanting in energy I think, so sometimes I conclude that 'tis want of ability.\\u00a0... I have no money\\u00a0\\u2013 not a cent.\\\"Kennedy (1987a), p. 15.\\n\\nMarriage\\nthumb|upright|alt=Nineteenth century photograph of a man in his 30s and a middle-aged woman standing side by side. He has a large moustache, and is looking at the woman; she is looking straight at the camera.|Edward and Alice Elgar, c.\\u00a01891\\nWhen Elgar was 29, he took on a new pupil, Caroline Alice Roberts, daughter of the late Major-General Sir Henry Roberts, and published author of verse and prose fiction. Eight years older than Elgar, Alice became his wife three years later. Elgar's biographer Michael Kennedy writes, \\\"Alice's family was horrified by her intention to marry an unknown musician who worked in a shop and was a Roman Catholic. She was disinherited.\\\" They were married on 8 May 1889, at Brompton Oratory. From then until her death, she acted as his business manager and social secretary, dealt with his mood swings, and was a perceptive musical critic.\\\"Some of Elgar's Friends\\\", The Musical Times, April 1934, p. 319Moore (1984), p. 587 She did her best to gain him the attention of influential society, though with limited success.Moore (1984), p. 134 In time, he would learn to accept the honours given him, realising that they mattered more to her and her social class and recognising what she had given up to further his career. In her diary, she wrote, \\\"The care of a genius is enough of a life work for any woman.\\\"Kennedy (1987a), p. 115. As an engagement present, Elgar dedicated his short violin-and-piano piece Salut d'Amour to her. With Alice's encouragement, the Elgars moved to London to be closer to the centre of British musical life, and Elgar started devoting his time to composition. Their only child, Carice Irene, was born at their home in West Kensington on 14 August 1890. Her name, revealed in Elgar's dedication of Salut d'Amour, was a contraction of her mother's names Caroline and Alice.\\n\\nElgar took full advantage of the opportunity to hear unfamiliar music. In the days before miniature scores and recordings were available, it was not easy for young composers to get to know new music.Anderson, Robert, \\\"Elgar's Musical Style\\\", The Musical Times, December 1993, pp. 689\\u201390 and 692. Retrieved 23 October 2010  Elgar took every chance to do so at the Crystal Palace concerts. He and Alice attended day after day, hearing music by a wide range of composers. Among these were masters of orchestration from whom he learned much, such as Berlioz and Richard Wagner. His own compositions, however, made little impact on London's musical scene. August Manns conducted Elgar's orchestral version of Salut d'amour and the Suite in D at the Crystal Palace, and two publishers accepted some of Elgar's violin pieces, organ voluntaries, and part songs.Reed, p. 23 Some tantalising opportunities seemed to be within reach but vanished unexpectedly. For example, an offer from the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, to run through some of his works was withdrawn at the last second when Sir Arthur Sullivan arrived unannounced to rehearse some of his own music. Sullivan was horrified when Elgar later told him what had happened. Elgar's only important commission while in London came from his home city: the Worcester Festival Committee invited him to compose a short orchestral work for the 1890 Three Choirs Festival.Reed, p. 25 The result is described by Diana McVeagh in the Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, as \\\"his first major work, the assured and uninhibited Froissart.\\\" Elgar conducted the first performance in Worcester in September 1890. For lack of other work, he was obliged to leave London in 1891 and return with his wife and child to Worcestershire, where he could earn a living conducting local musical ensembles and teaching. They settled in Alice's former home town, Great Malvern.\\n\\nGrowing reputation\\n\\nDuring the 1890s, Elgar gradually built up a reputation as a composer, chiefly of works for the great choral festivals of the English Midlands. The Black Knight (1892) and King Olaf (1896), both inspired by Longfellow, The Light of Life (1896) and Caractacus (1898) were all modestly successful, and he obtained a long-standing publisher in Novello and Co.The Musical Times, obituary of Elgar, April 1934, pp. 314\\u201318 Other works of this decade included the Serenade for Strings (1892) and Three Bavarian Dances (1897). Elgar was of enough consequence locally to recommend the young composer Samuel Coleridge-Taylor to the Three Choirs Festival for a concert piece, which helped establish the younger man's career. Elgar was catching the attention of prominent critics, but their reviews were polite rather than enthusiastic. Although he was in demand as a festival composer, he was only just getting by financially and felt unappreciated. In 1898, he said he was \\\"very sick at heart over music\\\" and hoped to find a way to succeed with a larger work. His friend August Jaeger tried to lift his spirits: \\\"A day's attack of the blues\\u00a0... will not drive away your desire, your necessity, which is to exercise those creative faculties which a kind providence has given you. Your time of universal recognition will come.\\\"Kennedy (1987a), p. 50.\\n\\nthumb|right|alt=A Victorian man of middle age, with a moustache, seated, reading a newspaper, viewed in profile from his left|August Jaeger, Elgar's publisher and friend, and \\\"Nimrod\\\" of the Enigma Variations\\nIn 1899, that prediction suddenly came true. At the age of forty-two, Elgar produced the Enigma Variations, which were premiered in London under the baton of the eminent German conductor Hans Richter. In Elgar's own words, \\\"I have sketched a set of Variations on an original theme. The Variations have amused me because I've labelled them with the nicknames of my particular friends\\u00a0... that is to say I've written the variations each one to represent the mood of the 'party' (the person)\\u00a0... and have written what I think they would have written \\u2013 if they were asses enough to compose\\\".Kennedy (1987a), p. 55. He dedicated the work \\\"To my friends pictured within\\\". Probably the best known variation is \\\"Nimrod\\\", depicting Jaeger. Purely musical considerations led Elgar to omit variations depicting Arthur Sullivan and Hubert Parry, whose styles he tried but failed to incorporate in the variations.McVeagh (1987), p. 51; Hughes, p. 72 The large-scale work was received with general acclaim for its originality, charm and craftsmanship, and it established Elgar as the pre-eminent British composer of his generation.\\n\\nThe work is formally titled Variations on an Original Theme; the word \\\"Enigma\\\" appears over the first six bars of music, which led to the familiar version of the title. The enigma is that, although there are fourteen variations on the \\\"original theme\\\", there is another overarching theme, never identified by Elgar, which he said \\\"runs through and over the whole set\\\" but is never heard. Later commentators have observed that although Elgar is today regarded as a characteristically English composer, his orchestral music and this work in particular share much with the Central European tradition typified at the time by the work of Richard Strauss. The Enigma Variations were well received in Germany and Italy,Atkins, Ivor, \\\"Elgar's 'Enigma' Variations\\\", The Musical Times, April 1934, pp. 328\\u201330 and remain to the present day a worldwide concert staple.\\n\\nNational and international fame\\nthumb|upright|alt=head and shoulders portrait of an elderly man looking directly at the painter.

Richter conducted the premiere, which was marred by a poorly prepared chorus, which sang badly.Reed, p. 60 Critics recognised the mastery of the piece despite the defects in performance. It was performed in D\\u00fcsseldorf, Germany, in 1901 and again in 1902, conducted by Julius Buths, who also conducted the European premiere of the Enigma Variations in 1901. The German press was enthusiastic. The Cologne Gazette said, \\\"In both parts we meet with beauties of imperishable value.\\u00a0... Elgar stands on the shoulders of Berlioz, Wagner, and Liszt, from whose influences he has freed himself until he has become an important individuality. He is one of the leaders of musical art of modern times.\\\" The D\\u00fcsseldorfer Volksblatt wrote, \\\"A memorable and epoch-making first performance!

According to Kennedy, \\\"It is unquestionably the greatest British work in the oratorio form\\u00a0... [it] opened a new chapter in the English choral tradition and liberated it from its Handelian preoccupation.\\\" Elgar, as a Roman Catholic, was much moved by Newman's poem about the death and redemption of a sinner, but some influential members of the Anglican establishment disagreed.

The contralto Clara Butt had persuaded him that the trio of the first Pomp and Circumstance march could have words fitted to it, and Elgar invited Benson to do so. Elgar incorporated the new vocal version into the Ode. The publishers of the score recognised the potential of the vocal piece, \\\"Land of Hope and Glory\\\", and asked Benson and Elgar to make a further revision for publication as a separate song.Moore (1984), pp. 364\\u201367 It was immensely popular and is now considered an unofficial British national anthem.

Between 1902 and 1914, Elgar was, in Kennedy's words, at the zenith of popularity. He made four visits to the US, including one conducting tour, and earned considerable fees from the performance of his music. Between 1905 and 1908, he held the post of Peyton Professor of Music at the University of Birmingham. He had accepted the post reluctantly, feeling that a composer should not head a school of music.Moore (1984), p. 446 He was not at ease in the role,Reed, p. 92 and his lectures caused controversy, with his attacks on the criticsReed, p. 89 and on English music in general: \\\"Vulgarity in the course of time may be refined.

Elgar visited America in that year to conduct his music and to accept a doctorate from Yale. His next large-scale work was the sequel to The Apostles \\u2013 the oratorio The Kingdom (1906). It was well received but did not catch the public imagination as The Dream of Gerontius had done and continued to do. Among keen Elgarians, however, The Kingdom was sometimes preferred to the earlier work: Elgar's friend Frank Schuster told the young Adrian Boult: \\\"compared with The Kingdom, Gerontius is the work of a raw amateur.\\\"Kennedy (1987b), p. 29. As Elgar approached his fiftieth birthday, he began work on his first symphony, a project that had been in his mind in various forms for nearly ten years.Reed, p. 96 His First Symphony (1908) was a national and international triumph. Within weeks of the premiere it was performed in New York under Walter Damrosch, Vienna under Ferdinand L\\u00f6we, St. Petersburg under Alexander Siloti, and Leipzig under Arthur Nikisch. There were performances in Rome, Chicago, Boston, Toronto and fifteen British towns and cities.

Elgar wrote it during the summer of 1910, with occasional help from W. H. Reed, the leader of the London Symphony Orchestra, who helped the composer with advice on technical points. Elgar and Reed formed a firm friendship, which lasted for the rest of Elgar's life. Reed's biography, Elgar As I Knew Him (1936), records many details of Elgar's methods of composition.Reed, p. 102 The work was presented by the Royal Philharmonic Society, with Kreisler and the London Symphony Orchestra, conducted by the composer. Reed recalled, \\\"the Concerto proved to be a complete triumph, the concert a brilliant and unforgettable occasion.\\\"Reed, p. 103 So great was the impact of the concerto that Kreisler's rival Eug\\u00e8ne Ysa\\u00ffe spent much time with Elgar going through the work. There was great disappointment when contractual difficulties prevented Ysa\\u00ffe from playing it in London.\\n\\nThe Violin Concerto was Elgar's last popular triumph. The following year he presented his Second Symphony in London, but was disappointed at its reception. Unlike the First Symphony, it ends not in a blaze of orchestral splendour but quietly and contemplatively. Reed, who played at the premiere, later wrote that Elgar was recalled to the platform several times to acknowledge the applause, \\\"but missed that unmistakable note perceived when an audience, even an English audience, is thoroughly roused or worked up, as it was after the Violin Concerto or the First Symphony.\\\"Reed, p. 105 Elgar asked Reed, \\\"What is the matter with them, Billy?

The following year, the Elgars moved back to London, to a large house in Netherhall Gardens, Hampstead, designed by Norman Shaw. There Elgar composed his last two large-scale works of the pre-war era, the choral ode, The Music Makers (for the Birmingham Festival, 1912) and the symphonic study Falstaff (for the Leeds Festival, 1913). Both were received politely but without enthusiasm.

His wife thought it best for him to move to the countryside, and she rented 'Brinkwells', a house near Fittleworth in Sussex, from the painter Rex Vicat Cole. There Elgar recovered his strength and, in 1918 and 1919, he produced four large-scale works. The first three of these were chamber pieces: the Violin Sonata in E\\u00a0minor, the Piano Quintet in A minor, and the String Quartet in E minor. On hearing the work in progress, Alice Elgar wrote in her diary, \\\"E. writing wonderful new music\\\".Oliver, Michael, Review, Gramophone, June 1986, p. 73 All three works were well received.

Elgar was the first composer to take full advantage of this technological advance. Fred Gaisberg of HMV, who produced Elgar's recordings, set up a series of sessions to capture on disc the composer's interpretations of his major orchestral works, including the Enigma Variations, Falstaff, the first and second symphonies, and the cello and violin concertos. For most of these, the orchestra was the LSO, but the Variations were played by the Royal Albert Hall Orchestra. Later in the series of recordings, Elgar also conducted two newly founded orchestras, Boult's BBC Symphony Orchestra and Sir Thomas Beecham's London Philharmonic Orchestra.\\n\\nElgar's recordings were released on 78-rpm discs by both HMV and RCA Victor. After World War II, the 1932 recording of the Violin Concerto with the teenage Menuhin as soloist remained available on 78 and later on LP, but the other recordings were out of the catalogues for some years. When they were reissued by EMI on LP in the 1970s, they caused surprise to many by their fast tempi, in contrast to the slower speeds adopted by many conductors in the years since Elgar's death.

While in France, he visited his fellow composer Frederick Delius at his house at Grez-sur-Loing.

In Elgar's chromaticism, the influence of Wagner is apparent, but Elgar's individual style of orchestration owes much to the clarity of nineteenth-century French composers, Berlioz, Massenet, Saint-Sa\\u00ebns and, particularly, Delibes, whose music Elgar played and conducted at Worcester and greatly admired.\\n\\nElgar began composing when still a child, and all his life he drew on his early sketchbooks for themes and inspiration.

Retrieved 22 April 2010. His early adult works included violin and piano pieces, music for the wind quintet in which he and his brother played between 1878 and 1881, and music of many types for the Powick Asylum band. Diana McVeagh in Grove's Dictionary finds many embryonic Elgarian touches in these pieces, but few of them are regularly played, except Salut d'Amour and (as arranged decades later into The Wand of Youth Suites) some of the childhood sketches. Elgar's sole work of note during his first spell in London in 1889\\u201391, the overture Froissart, was a romantic-bravura piece, influenced by Mendelssohn and Wagner, but also showing further Elgarian characteristics. Orchestral works composed during the subsequent years in Worcestershire include the Serenade for Strings and Three Bavarian Dances. In this period and later, Elgar wrote songs and partsongs. W. H. Reed expressed reservations about these pieces, but praised the partsong The Snow, for female voices, and Sea Pictures, a cycle of five songs for contralto and orchestra which remains in the repertory.Reed, p. 149\\n\\nElgar's principal large-scale early works were for chorus and orchestra for the Three Choirs and other festivals. These were The Black Knight, King Olaf, The Light of Life, The Banner of St George and Caractacus. He also wrote a Te Deum and Benedictus for the Hereford Festival. Of these, McVeagh comments favourably on his lavish orchestration and innovative use of leitmotifs, but less favourably on the qualities of his chosen texts and the patchiness of his inspiration. McVeagh makes the point that, because these works of the 1890s were for many years little known (and performances remain rare), the mastery of his first great success, the Enigma Variations, appeared to be a sudden transformation from mediocrity to genius, but in fact his orchestral skills had been building up throughout the decade.\\n\\nPeak creative years\\nthumb|300px|alt=large orchestra and their conductor seen on the platform of Victorian concert hall in long shot|Elgar and the London Symphony Orchestra at the Queen's Hall\\nElgar's best-known works were composed within the twenty-one years between 1899 and 1920. Most of them are orchestral. Reed wrote, \\\"Elgar's genius rose to its greatest height in his orchestral works\\\" and quoted the composer as saying that, even in his oratorios, the orchestral part is the most important.Reed, pp. 148\\u201350 The Enigma Variations made Elgar's name nationally. The variation form was ideal for him at this stage of his career, when his comprehensive mastery of orchestration was still in contrast to his tendency to write his melodies in short, sometimes rigid, phrases. His next orchestral works, Cockaigne, a concert-overture (1900\\u20131901), the first two Pomp and Circumstance marches (1901), and the gentle Dream Children (1902), are all short: the longest of them, Cockaigne, lasting less than fifteen minutes. In the South (1903\\u20131904), although designated by Elgar as a concert-overture, is, according to Kennedy, really a tone poem and the longest continuous piece of purely orchestral writing Elgar had essayed. He wrote it after setting aside an early attempt to compose a symphony.Kennedy (1970), p. 30 The work reveals his continuing progress in writing sustained themes and orchestral lines, although some critics, including Kennedy, find that in the middle part \\\"Elgar's inspiration burns at less than its brightest.\\\"Kennedy (1970), p. 32 In 1905 Elgar completed the Introduction and Allegro for Strings. This work is based, unlike much of Elgar's earlier writing, not on a profusion of themes but on only three. Kennedy called it a \\\"masterly composition, equalled among English works for strings only by Vaughan Williams's Tallis Fantasia.\\\"Kennedy (1970), p. 42 Nevertheless, at less than a quarter of an hour, it was not by contemporary standards a lengthy composition. Gustav Mahler's Seventh Symphony, composed at the same time, runs for well over an hour.\\n\\nDuring the next four years, however, Elgar composed three major concert pieces, which, though shorter than comparable works by some of his European contemporaries, are among the most substantial such works by an English composer. These were his First Symphony, Violin Concerto, and Second Symphony, which all play for between forty-five minutes and an hour. McVeagh says of the symphonies that they \\\"rank high not only in Elgar's output but in English musical history. Both are long and powerful, without published programmes, only hints and quotations to indicate some inward drama from which they derive their vitality and eloquence. Both are based on classical form but differ from it to the extent that\\u00a0... they were considered prolix and slackly constructed by some critics. Certainly the invention in them is copious; each symphony would need several dozen music examples to chart its progress.\\\"\\n\\nthumb|left|Fragment of manuscript of the opening of the second movement of the Cello Concerto|alt=manuscript music score, faded with age\\nElgar's Violin Concerto and Cello Concerto, in the view of Kennedy, \\\"rank not only among his finest works, but among the greatest of their kind\\\".Kennedy (1970), p. 43 They are, however, very different from each other. The Violin Concerto, composed in 1909 as Elgar reached the height of his popularity, and written for the instrument dearest to his heart, is lyrical throughout and rhapsodical and brilliant by turns.Kennedy (1970), p. 45 The Cello Concerto, composed a decade later, immediately after World War I, seems, in Kennedy's words, \\\"to belong to another age, another world\\u00a0... the simplest of all Elgar's major works\\u00a0... also the least grandiloquent.\\\"Kennedy (1970), p. 50 Between the two concertos came Elgar's symphonic study Falstaff, which has divided opinion even among Elgar's strongest admirers. Donald Tovey viewed it as \\\"one of the immeasurably great things in music\\\", with power \\\"identical with Shakespeare's\\\",Tovey, Donald F., \\\"Elgar, Master of Music\\\", Music and Letters, January 1935, p. 1 while Kennedy criticises the work for \\\"too frequent reliance on sequences\\\" and an over-idealised depiction of the female characters.Kennedy (1970), p. 35 Reed thought that the principal themes show less distinction than some of Elgar's earlier works.Reed, p. 151. Elgar himself thought Falstaff the highest point of his purely orchestral work.Reed, p. 113\\n\\nThe major works for voices and orchestra of the twenty-one years of Elgar's middle period are three large-scale works for soloists, chorus and orchestra: The Dream of Gerontius (1900), and the oratorios The Apostles (1903) and The Kingdom (1906); and two shorter odes, the Coronation Ode (1902) and The Music Makers (1912). The first of the odes, as a pi\\u00e8ce d'occasion, has rarely been revived after its initial success, with the culminating \\\"Land of Hope and Glory\\\". The second is, for Elgar, unusual in that it contains several quotations from his earlier works, as Richard Strauss quoted himself in Ein Heldenleben.Burn, Andrew, Notes to Naxos recording of The Music Makers (CD 8.557710) The choral works were all successful, although the first, Gerontius, was and remains the best-loved and most performed.Reed, p. 58 On the manuscript Elgar wrote, quoting John Ruskin, \\\"This is the best of me; for the rest, I ate, and drank, and slept, loved and hated, like another. My life was as the vapour, and is not; but this I saw, and knew; this, if anything of mine, is worth your memory.\\\" All three of the large-scale works follow the traditional model with sections for soloists, chorus and both together. Elgar's distinctive orchestration, as well as his melodic inspiration, lifts them to a higher level than most of their British predecessors.Reed, p. 150\\n\\nElgar's other works of his middle period include incidental music for Grania and Diarmid, a play by George Moore and W. B. Yeats (1901), and for The Starlight Express, a play based on a story by Algernon Blackwood (1916). Of the former, Yeats called Elgar's music \\\"wonderful in its heroic melancholy\\\".McVeagh (2007), p. 78 Elgar also wrote a number of songs during his peak period, of which Reed observes, \\\"it cannot be said that he enriched the vocal repertory to the same extent as he did that of the orchestra.\\\"\\n\\nFinal years and posthumous completions\\nAfter the Cello Concerto, Elgar completed no more large-scale works. He made arrangements of works by Bach, Handel and Chopin, in distinctively Elgarian orchestration, and once again turned his youthful notebooks to use for the Nursery Suite (1931). His other compositions of this period have not held a place in the regular repertory. For most of the rest of the twentieth century, it was generally agreed that Elgar's creative impulse ceased after his wife's death. Anthony Payne's elaboration of the sketches for Elgar's Third Symphony led to a reconsideration of this supposition. Elgar left the opening of the symphony complete in full score, and those pages, along with others, show Elgar's orchestration changed markedly from the richness of his pre-war work. The Gramophone described the opening of the new work as something \\\"thrilling\\u00a0... unforgettably gaunt\\\".Cowan, Rob, Review, Gramophone, March 2000, p. 61 Payne also subsequently produced a performing version of the sketches for a sixth Pomp and Circumstance March, premiered at the Proms in August 2006.Clements, Andrew, \\\"BBCSO/Davis\\\", The Guardian, 4 August 2006.

J. Turner, in the mid-twentieth century, wrote of Elgar's \\\"Salvation Army symphonies,\\\"Cox, pp. 15\\u201316 and Herbert von Karajan called the Enigma Variations \\\"second-hand Brahms\\\".Kennedy, Michael, \\\"Holst\\\", Gramophone, December 1990, p. 82 Elgar's immense popularity was not long-lived. After the success of his First Symphony and Violin Concerto, his Second Symphony and Cello Concerto were politely received but without the earlier wild enthusiasm. His music was identified in the public mind with the Edwardian era, and after the First World War he no longer seemed a progressive or modern composer. In the early 1920s, even the First Symphony had only one London performance in more than three years. Henry Wood and younger conductors such as Boult, Sargent and Barbirolli championed Elgar's music, but in the recording catalogues and the concert programmes of the middle of the century his works were not well represented.Sackville-West, pp. 253\\u201357\\n\\nIn 1924, the music scholar Edward J. Dent wrote an article for a German music journal in which he identified four features of Elgar's style that gave offence to a section of English opinion (namely, Dent indicated, the academic and snobbish section): \\\"too emotional\\\", \\\"not quite free from vulgarity\\\", \\\"pompous\\\", and \\\"too deliberately noble in expression\\\".Howes, pp. 165\\u201367 This article was reprinted in 1930 and caused controversy.Hale, Alfred M., \\\"The Elgar Protest\\\", The Musical Times, April 1931, p. 350; King, C.

The features that had offended austere taste in the inter-war years were seen from a different perspective. In 1955, the reference book The Record Guide wrote of the Edwardian background during the height of Elgar's career:\\n\\nBy the 1960s, a less severe view was being taken of the Edwardian era. In 1966 the critic Frank Howes wrote that Elgar reflected the last blaze of opulence, expansiveness and full-blooded life, before World War I swept so much away. In Howes's view, there was a touch of vulgarity in both the era and Elgar's music, but \\\"a composer is entitled to be judged by posterity for his best work.\\u00a0... Elgar is historically important for giving to English music a sense of the orchestra, for expressing what it felt like to be alive in the Edwardian age, for conferring on the world at least four unqualified masterpieces, and for thereby restoring England to the comity of musical nations.\\\"\\n\\nthumb|right|Composers who admired Elgar included (top) Sibelius (l) and Richard Strauss and (below) Vaughan Williams (l) and Stravinsky|alt=head and shoulders portraits of four men.

Cox noted that Elgar disliked folk-songs and never used them in his works, opting for an idiom that was essentially German, leavened by a lightness derived from French composers including Berlioz and Gounod. How then, asked Cox, could Elgar be \\\"the most English of composers\\\"? Cox found the answer in Elgar's own personality, which \\\"could use the alien idioms in such a way as to make of them a vital form of expression that was his and his alone. And the personality that comes through in the music is English.\\\" This point about Elgar's transmuting his influences had been touched on before. In 1930 The Times wrote, \\\"When Elgar's first symphony came out, someone attempted to prove that its main tune on which all depends was like the Grail theme in Parsifal.\\u00a0... but the attempt fell flat because everyone else, including those who disliked the tune, had instantly recognized it as typically 'Elgarian', while the Grail theme is as typically Wagnerian.\\\"\\\"Pre-war Symphonies\\\", The Times, 1 February 1930, p. 10 As for Elgar's \\\"Englishness\\\", his fellow-composers recognised it: Richard Strauss and Stravinsky made particular reference to it, and Sibelius called him, \\\"the personification of the true English character in music\\u00a0... a noble personality and a born aristocrat\\\".Sibelius, Jean, Igor Stravinsky, Richard Strauss and Arthur Nikisch, \\\"Tribute and Commentary\\\", The Musical Times, April 1934, p. 322.\\n\\nAmong Elgar's admirers there is disagreement about which of his works are to be regarded as masterpieces. The Enigma Variations are generally counted among them.Reed, p. 180; Kennedy (ODNB), McVeagh (Grove), Sackville-West, p. 254; and in a centenary symposium in 1957 a variety of composers, scholars and performers, include Enigma among their favourite Elgar works. See Vaughan Williams, Ralph, John Ireland, Julius Harrison, Arthur Bliss, Herbert Howells, Gordon Jacob, Jack Westrup, Edmund Rubbra, Steuart Wilson, Patrick Hadley, Herbert Sumsion, Frank Howes, Eric Blom, George Dyson, Thomas Armstrong, W. Greenhouse Allt, Edric Cundell, Ernest Bullock, R. J. F. Howgill, Maurice Johnstone and Eric Warr, \\\"Elgar Today\\\", The Musical Times, June 1957, pp. 302\\u201306. The Dream of Gerontius has also been given high praise by Elgarians,Sackville-West, Mc Veagh (Grove), Kennedy (ODNB), Reed (\\\"perhaps the greatest work of its kind in English music\\\", p. 61), and Vaughan Williams, Ralph, and others, \\\"Elgar Today\\\", The Musical Times, June 1957, pp. 302\\u201306. and the Cello Concerto is similarly rated. Many rate the Violin Concerto equally highly, but some do not. Sackville-West omitted it from the list of Elgar masterpieces in The Record Guide,Sackville West, p. 254 and in a long analytical article in The Musical Quarterly, Daniel Gregory Mason criticised the first movement of the concerto for a \\\"kind of sing-songiness\\u00a0... as fatal to noble rhythm in music as it is in poetry.\\\"Mason, Daniel Gregory, \\\"A Study of Elgar\\\", The Musical Quarterly, April 1917, pp. 288\\u2013303 Falstaff also divides opinion. It has never been a great popular favourite,\\\"Elgar\\\", Music and Letters, April 1934, p. 109 and Kennedy and Reed identify shortcomings in it.Kennedy (1970), p. 35; and Reed, p. 151. In a Musical Times 1957 centenary symposium on Elgar led by Vaughan Williams, by contrast, several contributors share Eric Blom's view that Falstaff is the greatest of all Elgar's works.Vaughan Williams, Ralph, and others, \\\"Elgar Today\\\",The Musical Times, June 1957, pp. 302\\u201306\\n\\nThe two symphonies divide opinion even more sharply. Mason rates the Second poorly for its \\\"over-obvious rhythmic scheme\\\", but calls the First \\\"Elgar's masterpiece.\\u00a0... It is hard to see how any candid student can deny the greatness of this symphony.\\\" However, in the 1957 centenary symposium, several leading admirers of Elgar express reservations about one or both symphonies. In the same year, Roger Fiske wrote in The Gramophone, \\\"For some reason few people seem to like the two Elgar symphonies equally; each has its champions and often they are more than a little bored by the rival work.\\\"Fiske, Roger, \\\"Elgar, Symphony No. 2 in E-flat major, Op. 63\\\", Gramophone, July 1957, p. 9 The critic John Warrack wrote, \\\"There are no sadder pages in symphonic literature than the close of the First Symphony's Adagio, as horn and trombones twice softly intone a phrase of utter grief\\\",Warrack, John, \\\"Three English Masters\\\", Gramophone, March 1984, p. 21 whereas to Michael Kennedy, the movement is notable for its lack of anguished yearning and angst and is marked instead by a \\\"benevolent tranquillity.\\\"Kennedy (1970), p. 56\\n\\nDespite the fluctuating critical assessment of the various works over the years, Elgar's major works taken as a whole have in the twenty-first century recovered strongly from their neglect in the 1950s. The Record Guide in 1955 could list only one currently available recording of the First Symphony, none of the Second, one of the Violin Concerto, two of the Cello Concerto, two of the Enigma Variations, one of Falstaff, and none of The Dream of Gerontius. Since then there have been multiple recordings of all the major works. More than thirty recordings have been made of the First Symphony since 1955, for example, and more than a dozen of The Dream of Gerontius.Farach-Colton, Andrew, \\\"Vision of the Hereafter,\\\" Gramophone, February 2003, p. 39 Similarly, in the concert hall, Elgar's works, after a period of neglect, are once again frequently programmed. The Elgar Society's website, in its diary of forthcoming performances, lists performances of Elgar's works by orchestras, soloists and conductors across Europe, North America and Australia.\\\"An Elgar Musical Diary\\\", The Elgar Society.

Another statue of the composer by Rose Garrard is at the top of Church Street in Malvern, overlooking the town and giving visitors an opportunity to stand next to the composer in the shadow of the Hills that he so often regarded. In September 2005, a third statue sculpted by Jemma Pearson was unveiled near Hereford Cathedral in honour of his many musical and other associations with the city. It depicts Elgar with his bicycle. From 1999 until early 2007, new Bank of England twenty pound notes featured a portrait of Elgar. The change to remove his image generated controversy, particularly because 2007 was the 150th anniversary of Elgar's birth.

In one scene, a ghostly Elgar whispers the secret of the \\\"Enigma\\\" tune to the youthful central character, with an injunction not to reveal it. Elgar on the Journey to Hanley, a novel by Keith Alldritt (1979), tells of the composer's attachment to Dora Penny, later Mrs Powell, (depicted as \\\"Dorabella\\\" in the Enigma Variations), and covers the fifteen years from their first meeting in the mid-1890s to the genesis of the Violin Concerto when, in the novel, Dora has been supplanted in Elgar's affections by Alice Stuart-Wortley.Banfield, Stephen, \\\"Fictional Elgar\\\", The Musical Times, October 1979, p. 830 \\n\\nPerhaps the best-known work depicting Elgar is Ken Russell's 1962 BBC television film Elgar, made when the composer was still largely out of fashion.
