"{\"title\": \"Ernest Hemingway\", \"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Hemingway\", \"text\": \"Ernest Miller Hemingway (July 21, 1899\\u00a0\\u2013 July 2, 1961) was an American journalist, novelist, short-story writer, and sportsman. His economical and understated style\\u2014which he termed the iceberg theory\\u2014had a strong influence on 20th-century fiction, while his adventurous lifestyle and his public image brought him admiration from later generations. Hemingway produced most of his work between the mid-1920s and the mid-1950s, and he won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954. He published seven novels, six short-story collections, and two non-fiction works. Three of his novels, four short-story collections, and three non-fiction works were published posthumously. Many of his works are considered classics of American literature.\\n\\nHemingway was raised in Oak Park, Illinois. After high school, he was a reporter for a few months for The Kansas City Star before leaving for the Italian Front to enlist as an ambulance driver in World War I. In 1918, he was seriously wounded and returned home. His wartime experiences formed the basis for his novel A Farewell to Arms (1929).\\n\\nIn 1921, Hemingway married Hadley Richardson, the first of four wives. They moved to Paris where he worked as a foreign correspondent and fell under the influence of the modernist writers and artists of the 1920s' \\\"Lost Generation\\\" expatriate community. His debut novel The Sun Also Rises was published in 1926. He divorced Richardson in 1927 and married Pauline Pfeiffer; they divorced after he returned from the Spanish Civil War, where he had been a journalist. He based For Whom the Bell Tolls (1940) on his experience there. Martha Gellhorn became his third wife in 1940; they separated after he met Mary Welsh in London during World War II. He was present with the troops as a journalist at the Normandy landings and the liberation of Paris.\\n\\nHemingway went on safari to Africa shortly after the publication of The Old Man and the Sea (1952), where he was involved in two successive near-fatal plane crashes that left him in pain and ill-health for much of the rest of his life. In 1959, he bought a house in Ketchum, Idaho where he ended his own life in mid-1961.\\n\\n Life \\n Early life \\n\\nthumb|right|upright|Hemingway was the second child and first son born to Clarence and Grace Hemingway.|alt= photograph of an infant\\nErnest Miller Hemingway was born on July 21, 1899, in his maternal grandfather's house in Oak Park, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago.Oliver (1999), 140 His father, Clarence Edmonds Hemingway, was a physician, and his mother, Grace Hall Hemingway, was a musician. Both were well-educated and well-respected in Oak Park, a conservative community about which resident  Frank Lloyd Wright said, \\\"So many churches for so many good people to go to.\\\"Meyers (1985), 4 For a short period after their marriage,Oliver (1999), 134 Clarence and Grace Hemingway lived with Grace's father, Ernest Hall, their first son's namesake.Hemingway had five siblings: Marcelline (1898); Ursula (1902); Madelaine (1904); Carol (1911); and Leicester (1915). See Reynolds (2000), 17\\u201318 Later, Ernest Hemingway would say that he disliked his name, which he \\\"associated with the naive, even foolish hero of Oscar Wilde's play The Importance of Being Earnest\\\".Meyers (1985), 8 The family eventually moved into a  seven-bedroom home in a respectable neighborhood with a music studio for Grace and a medical office for Clarence.Reynolds (2000), 17\\u201318\\n\\nHemingway's mother frequently performed in concerts around the village. As an adult, Hemingway professed to hate his mother, although biographer Michael S. Reynolds points out that Hemingway mirrored her energy and enthusiasm.Reynolds (2000), 19 Her insistence that he learn to play the cello became a \\\"source of conflict\\\", but he later admitted the music lessons were useful to his writing, as is evident in the \\\"contrapuntal structure\\\" of For Whom the Bell Tolls.Meyers (1985), 3 The family spent summers at Windemere on Walloon Lake, near Petoskey, Michigan. Hemingway's father taught him to hunt, fish, and camp in the woods and lakes of Northern Michigan as a young boy. These early experiences in nature instilled a passion for outdoor adventure and living in remote or isolated areas.Beegel (2000), 63\\u201371\\n\\nthumb|left|The Hemingway family in 1905 (from the left): Marcelline, Sunny, Clarence, Grace, Ursula, and Ernest\\n\\nFrom 1913 until 1917, Hemingway attended Oak Park and River Forest High School. He took part in a number of sports such as boxing, track and field, water polo, and football. He excelled in English classes,Mellow (1992), 21 and with his sister Marcelline, performed in the school orchestra for two years. During his junior year he had a journalism class, structured \\\"as though the classroom were a newspaper office,\\\" with better writers submitting pieces to the school newspaper, The Trapeze. Hemingway and Marcelline both submitted pieces; Hemingway's first piece, published in January 1916, was about a local performance by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.Griffin (1985), 25 He edited the Trapeze and the Tabula (the yearbook), imitating the language of sportswriters, taking the pen name Ring Lardner, Jr.\\u2014a nod to Ring Lardner of the Chicago Tribune whose byline was \\\"Line O'Type.\\\"\\n\\nLike Mark Twain, Stephen Crane, Theodore Dreiser, and Sinclair Lewis, Hemingway was a journalist before becoming a novelist. After leaving high school he went to work for The Kansas City Star as a cub reporter.Meyers (1985), 19\\u201323 Although he stayed there for only six months, he relied on the Stars style guide as a foundation for his writing: \\\"Use short sentences. Use short first paragraphs. Use vigorous English. Be positive, not negative.\\\"\\\"Star style and rules for writing\\\". The Kansas City Star. KansasCity.com.

He drove ambulances for two months until he was wounded.|alt= photograph of a young man dressed in a military uniform\\nEarly in 1918, after applying to serve with, and being turned down by, the US Army, Navy and Marines because of poor eyesight, Hemingway responded to a Red Cross recruitment effort in Kansas City and signed on to become an ambulance driver in Italy.Mellow (1992), 48\\u201349 He left New York in May and arrived in Paris as the city was under bombardment from German artillery.Meyers (1985), 27\\u201331 By June, he was at the Italian Front. It was probably around this time that he first met John Dos Passos, with whom he had a rocky relationship for decades.Pizer (1986) On his first day in Milan, he was sent to the scene of a munitions factory explosion, where rescuers retrieved the shredded remains of female workers. He described the incident in his non-fiction book Death in the Afternoon: \\\"I remember that after we searched quite thoroughly for the complete dead we collected fragments.\\\"Mellow (1992), 57\\u201360 A few days later, he was stationed at Fossalta di Piave.\\nthumb|left|Hemingway in American Red Cross Hospital, July 1918\\nOn July 8, he was seriously wounded by mortar fire, having just returned from the canteen bringing chocolate and cigarettes for the men at the front line. Despite his wounds, Hemingway assisted Italian soldiers to safety, for which he received the Italian Silver Medal of Bravery.Mellow (1992), 61On awarding the medal, the Italians wrote of Hemingway: \\\"Gravely wounded by numerous pieces of shrapnel from an enemy shell, with an admirable spirit of brotherhood, before taking care of himself, he rendered generous assistance to the Italian soldiers more seriously wounded by the same explosion and did not allow himself to be carried elsewhere until after they had been evacuated.\\\" See Mellow (1992), p. 61 He was still only 18 at the time. Hemingway later said of the incident: \\\"When you go to war as a boy you have a great illusion of immortality. Other people get killed; not you\\u00a0... Then when you are badly wounded the first time you lose that illusion and you know it can happen to you.\\\" He sustained severe shrapnel wounds to both legs, underwent an immediate operation at a distribution center, and spent five days at a field hospital before he was transferred for recuperation to the Red Cross hospital in Milan.Desnoyers, 3 He spent six months at the hospital, where he met and formed a strong friendship with \\\"Chink\\\" Dorman-Smith that lasted for decades and shared a room with future American foreign service officer, ambassador, and author Henry Serrano Villard.Meyers (1985), 37\\u201342, 34\\n\\nWhile recuperating, he fell in love for the first time with Agnes von Kurowsky, a Red Cross nurse seven years his senior. By the time of his release and return to the United States in January 1919, Agnes and Hemingway had decided to marry within a few months in America. However, in March, she wrote that she had become engaged to an Italian officer. Biographer Jeffrey Meyers states in his book Hemingway: A Biography that Hemingway was devastated by Agnes's rejection, and in future relationships, he followed a pattern of abandoning a wife before she abandoned him.Meyers (1985), 37\\u201342\\n\\n Toronto and Chicago \\nHemingway returned home early in 1919 to a time of readjustment. Before the age of 20, he had gained from the war a maturity that was at odds with living at home without a job and with the need for recuperation.Meyers (1985), 45\\u201353 As Reynolds explains, \\\"Hemingway could not really tell his parents what he thought when he saw his bloody knee.\\\" He was not able to tell them how scared he had been \\\"in another country with surgeons who could not tell him in English if his leg was coming off or not.\\\"Reynolds (1998), 21\\n\\nIn September, he took a fishing and camping trip with high school friends to the back-country of Michigan's Upper Peninsula. The trip became the inspiration for his short story \\\"Big Two-Hearted River\\\", in which the semi-autobiographical character Nick Adams takes to the country to find solitude after returning from war.Mellow (1992), 101 A family friend offered him a job in Toronto, and with nothing else to do, he accepted. Late that year he began as a freelancer and staff writer for the Toronto Star Weekly. He returned to Michigan the following June and then moved to Chicago in September 1920 to live with friends, while still filing stories for the Toronto Star. In Chicago, he worked as an associate editor of the monthly journal Cooperative Commonwealth, where he met novelist Sherwood Anderson.Meyers (1985), 56\\u201358\\n\\nWhen St. Louis native Hadley Richardson came to Chicago to visit the sister of Hemingway's roommate, Hemingway became infatuated. He later claimed, \\\"I knew she was the girl I was going to marry.\\\" Hadley, red-haired, with a \\\"nurturing instinct,\\\" was eight years older than Hemingway. Despite the age difference, Hadley, who had grown up with an overprotective mother, seemed less mature than usual for a young woman her age.Oliver (1999), 139 Bernice Kert, author of The Hemingway Women, claims Hadley was \\\"evocative\\\" of Agnes, but that Hadley had a childishness that Agnes lacked. The two corresponded for a few months and then decided to marry and travel to Europe.Kert (1983), 83\\u201390 They wanted to visit Rome, but Sherwood Anderson convinced them to visit Paris instead, writing letters of introduction for the young couple.Baker (1972), 7 They were married on September 3, 1921; two months later, Hemingway was hired as foreign correspondent for the Toronto Star, and the couple left for Paris. Of Hemingway's marriage to Hadley, Meyers claims: \\\"With Hadley, Hemingway achieved everything he had hoped for with Agnes: the love of a beautiful woman, a comfortable income, a life in Europe.\\\"Meyers (1985), 60\\u201362\\n\\n Paris \\nthumb|upright|Hemingway's 1923 passport photo. At this time, he lived in Paris with his wife Hadley, and worked as a foreign correspondent for the Toronto Star Weekly.|alt=Passport photograph\\nCarlos Baker, Hemingway's first biographer, believes that while Anderson suggested Paris because \\\"the monetary exchange rate\\\" made it an inexpensive place to live, more importantly it was where \\\"the most interesting people in the world\\\" lived. In Paris, Hemingway met American writer and art collector Gertrude Stein, Irish novelist James Joyce, American poet Ezra Pound (who \\\"could help a young writer up the rungs of a career\\\") and other writers.\\n\\nThe Hemingway of the early Paris years was a \\\"tall, handsome, muscular, broad-shouldered, brown-eyed, rosy-cheeked, square-jawed, soft-voiced young man.\\\" He and Hadley lived in a small walk-up at 74 rue du Cardinal Lemoine  in the Latin Quarter, and he worked in a rented room in a nearby building.  Stein, who was the bastion of modernism in Paris,Mellow (1991), 8 became Hemingway's mentor and godmother to his son Jack;Meyers (1985) she introduced him to the expatriate artists and writers of the Montparnasse Quarter, whom she referred to as the \\\"Lost Generation\\\"\\u2014a term Hemingway popularized with the publication of The Sun Also Rises.Mellow (1992), 308 A regular at Stein's salon, Hemingway met influential painters such as Pablo Picasso, Joan Mir\\u00f3, and Juan Gris.Reynolds (2000), 28 He eventually withdrew from Stein's influence and their relationship deteriorated into a literary quarrel that spanned decades.Meyers (1985), 77\\u201381 Ezra Pound met Hemingway by chance at Sylvia Beach's bookshop Shakespeare and Company in 1922. The two toured Italy in 1923 and lived on the same street in 1924.Meyers (1985), 70\\u201374 They forged a strong friendship, and in Hemingway, Pound recognized and fostered a young talent. Pound introduced Hemingway to James Joyce, with whom Hemingway frequently embarked on \\\"alcoholic sprees\\\".Meyers (1985), 82\\n\\nDuring his first 20 months in Paris, Hemingway filed 88 stories for the Toronto Star newspaper.Reynolds (2000), 24 He covered the Greco-Turkish War, where he witnessed the burning of Smyrna, and wrote travel pieces such as \\\"Tuna Fishing in Spain\\\" and \\\"Trout Fishing All Across Europe: Spain Has the Best, Then Germany\\\".Desnoyers, 5 Hemingway was devastated on learning that Hadley had lost a suitcase filled with his manuscripts at the Gare de Lyon as she was traveling to Geneva to meet him in December 1922.Meyers (1985), 69\\u201370 The following September, the couple returned to Toronto, where their son John Hadley Nicanor was born on October 10, 1923. During their absence, Hemingway's first book, Three Stories and Ten Poems, was published. Two of the stories it contained were all that remained after the loss of the suitcase, and the third had been written early the previous year in Italy. Within months a second volume, in our time (without capitals), was published. The small volume included six vignettes and a dozen stories Hemingway had written the previous summer during his first visit to Spain, where he discovered the thrill of the corrida. He missed Paris, considered Toronto boring, and wanted to return to the life of a writer, rather than live the life of a journalist.Baker (1972), 15\\u201318\\n\\nHemingway, Hadley and their son (nicknamed Bumby) returned to Paris in January 1924 and moved into a new apartment on the rue Notre-Dame des Champs. Hemingway helped Ford Madox Ford edit The Transatlantic Review, which published works by Pound, John Dos Passos, Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven, and Stein, as well as some of Hemingway's own early stories such as \\\"Indian Camp\\\".Meyers (1985), 126 When In Our Time was published in 1925, the dust jacket bore comments from Ford.Baker (1972), 34Meyers (1985), 127 \\\"Indian Camp\\\" received considerable praise; Ford saw it as an important early story by a young writer,Mellow (1992), 236 and critics in the United States praised Hemingway for reinvigorating the short story genre with his crisp style and use of declarative sentences.Mellow (1992), 314 Six months earlier, Hemingway had met F. Scott Fitzgerald, and the pair formed a friendship of \\\"admiration and hostility\\\".Meyers (1985), 159\\u2013160 Fitzgerald had published The Great Gatsby the same year: Hemingway read it, liked it, and decided his next work had to be a novel.Baker (1972), 30\\u201334\\n\\nWith his wife Hadley, Hemingway first visited the Festival of San Ferm\\u00edn in Pamplona, Spain, in 1923, where he became fascinated by bullfighting.Meyers (1985), 117\\u2013119 It is at this time that he began to be referred to as \\\"Papa\\\", even by much older friends. Hadley would much later recall that Hemingway had his own nicknames for everyone, and that he often did things for his friends; she suggested that he liked to be looked up to. She didn't remember precisely how the nickname came into being; however, it certainly stuck. Reprinted in  Published at  The Hemingways returned to Pamplona in 1924 and a third time in June 1925; that year they brought with them a group of American and British expatriates: Hemingway's Michigan boyhood friend Bill Smith, Donald Ogden Stewart, Lady Duff Twysden (recently divorced), her lover Pat Guthrie, and Harold Loeb.Nagel (1996), 89 A few days after the fiesta ended, on his birthday (July 21), he began to write the draft of what would become The Sun Also Rises, finishing eight weeks later.Meyers (1985), 189  A few months later, in December 1925, the Hemingways left to spend the winter in Schruns, Austria, where Hemingway began revising the manuscript extensively. Pauline Pfeiffer joined them in January and against Hadley's advice, urged Hemingway to sign a contract with Scribner's. He left Austria for a quick trip to New York to meet with the publishers, and on his return, during a stop in Paris, began an affair with Pfeiffer, before returning to Schruns to finish the revisions in March.Reynolds (1989), vi\\u2013vii  The manuscript arrived in New York in April; he corrected the final proof in Paris in August 1926, and Scribner's published the novel in October.Mellow (1992), 328Baker (1972), 44\\n\\nThe Sun Also Rises epitomized the post-war expatriate generation,Mellow (1992), 302 received good reviews, and is \\\"recognized as Hemingway's greatest work\\\".Meyers (1985), 192 Hemingway himself later wrote to his editor Max Perkins that the \\\"point of the book\\\" was not so much about a generation being lost, but that \\\"the earth abideth forever\\\"; he believed the characters in The Sun Also Rises may have been \\\"battered\\\" but were not lost.Baker (1972), 82\\n\\nHemingway's marriage to Hadley deteriorated as he was working on The Sun Also Rises. In early 1926, Hadley became aware of his affair with Pfeiffer, who came to Pamplona with them that July.Baker (1972), 43Mellow (1992), 333 On their return to Paris, Hadley asked for a separation; in November she formally requested a divorce. They split their possessions while Hadley accepted Hemingway's offer of the proceeds from The Sun Also Rises.Mellow (1992), 338\\u2013340 The couple were divorced in January 1927, and Hemingway married Pfeiffer in May.Meyers (1985), 172\\n\\nthumb|Ernest and Pauline Hemingway in Paris, 1927\\n\\nPfeiffer, who was from a wealthy Catholic Arkansas family, had moved to  Paris to work for Vogue magazine. Before their marriage, Hemingway converted to Catholicism.Meyers (1985), 173, 184 They honeymooned in Le Grau-du-Roi, where he contracted anthrax, and he planned his next collection of short stories,Mellow (1992), 348\\u2013353 Men Without Women, which was published in October 1927,Meyers (1985), 195 and included his boxing story \\\"Fifty Grand\\\". Cosmopolitan magazine editor-in-chief Ray Long praised \\\"Fifty Grand\\\", calling it, \\\"one of the best short stories that ever came to my hands\\u00a0... the best prize-fight story I ever read\\u00a0... a remarkable piece of realism.\\\"Long (1932), 2\\u20133\\n\\nBy the end of the year Pauline, who was pregnant, wanted to move back to America. John Dos Passos recommended Key West, and they left Paris in March 1928. Hemingway suffered a severe injury in their Paris bathroom when he pulled a skylight down on his head thinking he was pulling on a toilet chain. This left him with a prominent forehead scar, which he carried for the rest of his life. When Hemingway was asked about the scar, he was reluctant to answer.Robinson (2005) After his departure from Paris, Hemingway \\\"never again lived in a big city\\\".Meyers (1985), 204\\n\\n Key West and the Caribbean \\nthumb|The Hemingway House in Key West, Florida, where he lived between 1931 and 1939 and where he wrote To Have and Have Not|alt=photograph of a house\\n\\nHemingway and Pauline traveled to Kansas City, where their son Patrick was born on June 28, 1928. Pauline had a difficult delivery; Hemingway fictionalized a version of the event as a part of A Farewell to Arms. After Patrick's birth, Pauline and Hemingway traveled to Wyoming, Massachusetts, and New York.Meyers (1985), 208 In the winter, he was in New York with Bumby, about to board a train to Florida, when he received a cable telling him that his father had killed himself.Clarence Hemingway used his father's Civil War pistol to shoot himself. See Meyers (1985), 2Mellow (1992), 367 Hemingway was devastated, having earlier written to his father telling him not to worry about financial difficulties; the letter arrived minutes after the suicide. He realized how Hadley must have felt after her own father's suicide in 1903, and he commented, \\\"I'll probably go the same way.\\\"qtd. in Meyers (1985), 210\\n\\nUpon his return to Key West in December, Hemingway worked on the draft of A Farewell to Arms before leaving for France in January. He had finished it in August but delayed the revision. The serialization in Scribner's Magazine was scheduled to begin in May, but as late as April, Hemingway was still working on the ending, which he may have rewritten as many as seventeen times. The completed novel was published on September 27.Meyers (1985), 215 Biographer James Mellow believes A Farewell to Arms established Hemingway's stature as a major American writer and displayed a level of complexity not apparent in The Sun Also Rises.Mellow (1992), 378 In Spain in mid-1929, Hemingway researched his next work, Death in the Afternoon. He wanted to write a comprehensive treatise on bullfighting, explaining the toreros and corridas complete with glossaries and appendices, because he believed bullfighting was \\\"of great tragic interest, being literally of life and death.\\\"Baker (1972), 144\\u2013145\\n\\nDuring the early 1930s, Hemingway spent his winters in Key West and summers in Wyoming, where he found \\\"the most beautiful country he had seen in the American West\\\" and hunted deer, elk, and grizzly bear.Meyers (1985), 222 He was joined there by Dos Passos and in November 1930, after bringing Dos Passos to the train station in Billings, Montana, Hemingway broke his arm in a car accident. The surgeon tended the compound spiral fracture and bound the bone with kangaroo tendon. Hemingway was hospitalized for seven weeks, with Pauline tending to him; the nerves in his writing hand took as long as a year to heal, during which time he suffered intense pain.Reynolds (2000), 31\\n\\nthumb|left|Ernest, Pauline, Bumby, Patrick, and Gregory Hemingway pose with marlins after a fishing trip to Bimini in 1935|alt=photograph of a man, a woman, and three boys\\n\\nHis third son, Gregory Hancock Hemingway, was born a year later on November 12, 1931, in Kansas City.Oliver (1999), 144Gregory Hemingway would undergo sex reassignment surgery in the mid-1990s and thereafter was known as Gloria Hemingway.

Pauline's uncle bought the couple a house in Key West with a carriage house, the second floor of which was converted into a writing studio.Meyers (1985), 222\\u2013227 While in Key West, Hemingway frequented the local bar Sloppy Joe's.Mellow (1992), 402 He invited friends\\u2014including Waldo Peirce, Dos Passos, and Max PerkinsMellow (1992), 376\\u2013377\\u2014to join him on fishing trips and on an all-male expedition to the Dry Tortugas. Meanwhile, he continued to travel to Europe and to Cuba, and\\u2014although in 1933 he wrote of Key West, \\\"We have a fine house here, and kids are all well\\\"\\u2014Mellow believes he \\\"was plainly restless\\\".Mellow (1992), 424\\n\\nIn 1933, Hemingway and Pauline went on safari to East Africa. The 10-week trip provided material for Green Hills of Africa, as well as for the short stories \\\"The Snows of Kilimanjaro\\\" and \\\"The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber\\\".Desnoyers, 9 The couple visited Mombasa, Nairobi, and Machakos in Kenya; then moved on to Tanganyika Territory, where they hunted in the Serengeti, around Lake Manyara, and west and southeast of present-day Tarangire National Park. Their guide was the noted \\\"white hunter\\\" Philip Percival who had guided Theodore Roosevelt on his 1909 safari. During these travels, Hemingway contracted amoebic dysentery that caused a prolapsed intestine, and he was evacuated by plane to Nairobi, an experience reflected in \\\"The Snows of Kilimanjaro\\\". On Hemingway's return to Key West in early 1934, he began work on Green Hills of Africa, which he published in 1935 to mixed reviews.Mellow (1992), 337\\u2013340\\n\\nHemingway bought a boat in 1934, named it the Pilar, and began sailing the Caribbean.Meyers (1985), 280 In 1935 he first arrived at Bimini, where he spent a considerable amount of time. During this period he also worked on To Have and Have Not, published in 1937 while he was in Spain, the only novel he wrote during the 1930s.Meyers (1985), 292\\n\\n Spanish Civil War \\nthumb|Hemingway (center) with Dutch filmmaker Joris Ivens and German writer Ludwig Renn (serving as an International Brigades officer) in Spain during Spanish Civil War, 1937|alt=photograph of three men\\n\\nIn 1937, Hemingway agreed to report on the Spanish Civil War for the North American Newspaper Alliance (NANA),Mellow (1992), 488 arriving in Spain in March with Dutch filmmaker Joris Ivens.Koch (2005), 87 Ivens was filming The Spanish Earth, a propaganda film in support of the Republican side. He wanted Hemingway to replace John Dos Passos as screenwriter, since Dos Passos had left the project when his friend Jos\\u00e9 Robles was arrested and later executed.Meyers (1985), 311 The incident changed Dos Passos' initially positive opinion of the leftist republicans, creating a rift between him and Hemingway, who later spread a rumor that Dos Passos left Spain out of cowardice.Koch (2005), 164 He also rubbed shoulders with US volunteers fighting on the Republican side, including the ace fighter pilot Frank G. Tinker and Robert Hale Merriman, leader of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.\\n\\nJournalist and writer Martha Gellhorn, whom Hemingway had met in Key West the previous Christmas (1936), joined him in Spain. Like Hadley, Martha was a St. Louis native, and like Pauline, she had worked for Vogue in Paris. Of Martha, Kert explains, \\\"she never catered to him the way other women did\\\".Kert (1983), 287\\u2013295 Late in 1937, while in Madrid with Martha, Hemingway wrote his only play, The Fifth Column, as the city was being bombarded by Francoist forces.Koch (2005), 134 He returned to Key West for a few months, then back to Spain twice in 1938, where he was present at the Battle of the Ebro, the last republican stand, and he was among the British and American journalists who were some of the last to leave the battle as they crossed the river.Meyers (1985), 321Thomas (2001), 833\\n\\n Cuba \\nIn early 1939, Hemingway crossed to Cuba in his boat to live in the Hotel Ambos Mundos in Havana. This was the separation phase of a slow and painful split from Pauline, which began when Hemingway met Martha Gellhorn.Meyers (1985), 326 Martha soon joined him in Cuba, and they rented \\\"Finca Vig\\u00eda\\\" (\\\"Lookout Farm\\\"), a  property  from Havana. Pauline and the children left Hemingway that summer, after the family was reunited during a visit to Wyoming; when his divorce from Pauline was finalized, he and Martha were married on November 20, 1940 in Cheyenne, Wyoming.Lynn (1987), 479\\n\\nHemingway moved his primary summer residence to Ketchum, Idaho, just outside the newly built resort of Sun Valley, and moved his winter residence to Cuba.Meyers (1985), 342 He had been disgusted when a Parisian friend allowed his cats to eat from the table, but he became enamored of cats in Cuba and kept dozens of them on the property.Meyers (1985), 353\\n\\nGellhorn inspired him to write his most famous novel For Whom the Bell Tolls, which he started in March 1939 and finished in July 1940. It was published in October 1940.Meyers (1985), 334 His pattern was to move around while working on a manuscript, and he wrote For Whom the Bell Tolls in Cuba, Wyoming, and Sun Valley. It became a Book-of-the-Month Club choice, sold half a million copies within months, was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize, and \\\"triumphantly re-established Hemingway's literary reputation\\\" in the words of Meyers.Meyers (1985), 334\\u2013338\\n\\nIn January 1941, Martha was sent to China on assignment for Collier's magazine. Hemingway went with her, sending in dispatches for the newspaper PM, but in general he disliked China.Meyers (1985), 356\\u2013361 A 2009 book suggests during that period he may have been recruited to work for Soviet intelligence agents under the name \\\"Agent Argo\\\". They returned to Cuba before the declaration of war by the United States that December, when he convinced the Cuban government to help him refit the Pilar, which he intended to use to ambush German submarines off the coast of Cuba.\\n\\n World War II \\nthumb|upright|Hemingway with Col.

When he arrived in London, he met Time magazine correspondent Mary Welsh, with whom he became infatuated. Martha had been forced to cross the Atlantic in a ship filled with explosives because Hemingway refused to help her get a press pass on a plane, and she arrived in London to find him hospitalized with a concussion from a car accident. She was unsympathetic to his plight; she accused him of being a bully and told him that she was \\\"through, absolutely finished\\\".Kert (1983), 393\\u2013398 The last time that Hemingway saw Martha was in March 1945 as he was preparing to return to Cuba,Meyers (1985), 416 and their divorce was finalized later that year. Meanwhile, he had asked Mary Welsh to marry him on their third meeting.\\n\\nHemingway accompanied the troops to the Normandy Landings wearing a large head bandage, according to Meyers, but he was considered \\\"precious cargo\\\" and not allowed ashore.Meyers (1985), 400 The landing craft came within sight of Omaha Beach before coming under enemy fire and turning back. Hemingway later wrote in Collier's that he could see \\\"the first, second, third, fourth and fifth waves of [landing troops] lay where they had fallen, looking like so many heavily laden bundles on the flat pebbly stretch between the sea and first cover\\\".Reynolds (1999), 96\\u201398 Mellow explains that, on that first day, none of the correspondents were allowed to land and Hemingway was returned to the Dorothea Dix.Mellow (1992), 533\\n\\nLate in July, he attached himself to \\\"the 22nd Infantry Regiment commanded by Col. Charles 'Buck' Lanham, as it drove toward Paris\\\", and Hemingway became de facto leader to a small band of village militia in Rambouillet outside of Paris.Meyers (1985), 398\\u2013405 Paul Fussell remarks: \\\"Hemingway got into considerable trouble playing infantry captain to a group of Resistance people that he gathered because a correspondent is not supposed to lead troops, even if he does it well.\\\" This was in fact in contravention of the Geneva Convention,  and Hemingway was brought up on formal charges; he said that he \\\"beat the rap\\\" by claiming that he only offered advice.Lynn (1987), 518\\u2013519\\n\\nOn August 25, he was present at the liberation of Paris as a journalist; contrary to the Hemingway legend, he was not the first into the city, nor did he liberate the Ritz.Meyers (1985) 408\\u2013411 In Paris, he visited Sylvia Beach and Pablo Picasso with Mary Welsh, who joined him there; in a spirit of happiness, he forgave Gertrude Stein.Mellow (1992), 535\\u2013540 Later that year, he observed heavy fighting in the Battle of H\\u00fcrtgen Forest. On December 17, 1944, he had himself driven to Luxembourg in spite of illness to cover The Battle of the Bulge. As soon as he arrived, however, Lanham handed him to the doctors, who hospitalized him with pneumonia; he recovered a week later, but most of the fighting was over.\\n\\nIn 1947, Hemingway was awarded a Bronze Star for his bravery during World War II. He was recognized for having been \\\"under fire in combat areas in order to obtain an accurate picture of conditions\\\", with the commendation that \\\"through his talent of expression, Mr. Hemingway enabled readers to obtain a vivid picture of the difficulties and triumphs of the front-line soldier and his organization in combat\\\".\\n\\n Cuba and the Nobel Prize \\nHemingway said he \\\"was out of business as a writer\\\" from 1942 to 1945 during his residence in Cuba.qtd. in Mellow (1992), 552 In 1946 he married Mary, who had an ectopic pregnancy five months later. The Hemingway family suffered a series of accidents and health problems in the years following the war: in a 1945 car accident, he \\\"smashed his knee\\\" and sustained another \\\"deep wound on his forehead\\\"; Mary broke first her right ankle and then her left in successive skiing accidents. A 1947 car accident left Patrick with a head wound and severely ill.Meyers (1985), 420\\u2013421 Hemingway sank into depression as his literary friends began to die: in 1939 William Butler Yeats and Ford Madox Ford; in 1940 Scott Fitzgerald; in 1941 Sherwood Anderson and James Joyce; in 1946 Gertrude Stein; and the following year in 1947, Max Perkins, Hemingway's long-time Scribner's editor and friend.Mellow (1992) 548\\u2013550 During this period, he suffered from severe headaches, high blood pressure, weight problems, and eventually diabetes\\u2014much of which was the result of previous accidents and many years of heavy drinking.Desnoyers, 12 Nonetheless, in January 1946, he began work on The Garden of Eden, finishing 800 pages by June.Meyers (1985), 436The Garden of Eden was published posthumously in 1986. See Meyers (1985), 436 During the post-war years, he also began work on a trilogy tentatively titled \\\"The Land\\\", \\\"The Sea\\\" and \\\"The Air\\\", which he wanted to combine in one novel titled The Sea Book.  However, both projects stalled, and Mellow says that Hemingway's inability to continue was \\\"a symptom of his troubles\\\" during these years.Mellow (1992), 552The manuscript for The Sea Book was published posthumously as Islands in the Stream in 1970. See Mellow (1992), 552\\n\\nIn 1948, Hemingway and Mary traveled to Europe, staying in Venice for several months. While there, Hemingway fell in love with the then 19-year-old Adriana Ivancich. The platonic love affair inspired the novel Across the River and into the Trees, written in Cuba during a time of strife with Mary, and published in 1950 to negative reviews.Meyers (1985), 440\\u2013452 The following year, furious at the critical reception of Across the River and Into the Trees, he wrote the draft of The Old Man and the Sea in eight weeks, saying that it was \\\"the best I can write ever for all of my life\\\". The Old Man and the Sea became a book-of-the-month selection, made Hemingway an international celebrity, and won the Pulitzer Prize in May 1952, a month before he left for his second trip to Africa.Desnoyers, 13Meyers (1985), 489\\n\\nIn 1954, while in Africa, Hemingway was almost fatally injured in two successive plane crashes. He chartered a sightseeing flight over the Belgian Congo as a Christmas present to Mary. On their way to photograph Murchison Falls from the air, the plane struck an abandoned utility pole and \\\"crash landed in heavy brush\\\". Hemingway's injuries included a head wound, while Mary broke two ribs.Baker (1972), 331\\u2013333 The next day, attempting to reach medical care in Entebbe, they boarded a second plane that exploded at take-off, with Hemingway suffering burns and another concussion, this one serious enough to cause leaking of cerebral fluid.Mellow (1992), 586 They eventually arrived in Entebbe to find reporters covering the story of Hemingway's death. He briefed the reporters and spent the next few weeks recuperating and reading his erroneous obituaries.Mellow (1992), 587 Despite his injuries, Hemingway accompanied Patrick and his wife on a planned fishing expedition in February, but pain caused him to be irascible and difficult to get along with.Mellow (1992), 588 When a bushfire broke out, he was again injured, sustaining second degree burns on his legs, front torso, lips, left hand and right forearm.Meyers (1985), 505\\u2013507 Months later in Venice, Mary reported to friends the full extent of Hemingway's injuries: two cracked discs, a kidney and liver rupture, a dislocated shoulder and a broken skull. The accidents may have precipitated the physical deterioration that was to follow. After the plane crashes, Hemingway, who had been \\\"a thinly controlled alcoholic throughout much of his life, drank more heavily than usual to combat the pain of his injuries.\\\"Beegel (1996), 273\\n\\nthumb|left|Hemingway in the cabin of his boat Pilar, off the coast of Cuba, c. 1950|alt=photograph of a man\\n\\nIn October 1954, Hemingway received the Nobel Prize in Literature. He modestly told the press that Carl Sandburg, Isak Dinesen and Bernard Berenson deserved the prize,Lynn (1987), 574 but he gladly accepted the prize money.Baker (1972), 38 Mellow says Hemingway \\\"had coveted the Nobel Prize\\\", but when he won it, months after his plane accidents and the ensuing worldwide press coverage, \\\"there must have been a lingering suspicion in Hemingway's mind that his obituary notices had played a part in the academy's decision.\\\"Mellow (1992), 588\\u2013589 Because he was suffering pain from the African accidents, he decided against traveling to Stockholm.Meyers (1985), 509 Instead he sent a speech to be read, defining the writer's life: \\n\\nFrom the end of the year in 1955 to early 1956, Hemingway was bedridden.Meyers (1985), 512 He was told to stop drinking to mitigate liver damage, advice he initially followed but then disregarded.Reynolds (2000), 291\\u2013293 In October 1956, he returned to Europe and met Basque writer Pio Baroja, who was seriously ill and died weeks later. During the trip, Hemingway became sick again and was treated for \\\"high blood pressure, liver disease, and arteriosclerosis\\\".\\n\\nIn November 1956, while staying in Paris, he was reminded of trunks he had stored in the Ritz Hotel in 1928 and never retrieved. Upon re-claiming and opening the trunks, Hemingway discovered they were filled with notebooks and writing from his Paris years. Excited about the discovery, when he returned to Cuba in early 1957, he began to shape the recovered work into his memoir A Moveable Feast.Meyers (1985), 533 By 1959 he ended a period of intense activity: he finished A Moveable Feast (scheduled to be released the following year); brought True at First Light to 200,000 words; added chapters to The Garden of Eden; and worked on Islands in the Stream. The last three were stored in a safe deposit box in Havana, as he focused on the finishing touches for A Moveable Feast. Author Michael Reynolds claims it was during this period that Hemingway slid into depression, from which he was unable to recover.Reynolds (1999), 321\\n\\nThe Finca Vigia became crowded with guests and tourists, as Hemingway, beginning to become unhappy with life there, considered a permanent move to Idaho. In 1959 he bought a home overlooking the Big Wood River, outside Ketchum, and left Cuba\\u2014although he apparently remained on easy terms with the Castro government, telling The New York Times he was \\\"delighted\\\" with Castro's overthrow of Batista.Mellow (1992), 494\\u2013495Meyers (1985), 516\\u2013519 He was in Cuba in November 1959, between returning from Pamplona and traveling west to Idaho, and the following year for his 61st birthday; however, that year he and Mary decided to leave after hearing the news that Castro wanted to nationalize property owned by Americans and other foreign nationals.Reynolds (2000), 332, 344 On July 25, 1960, the Hemingways left Cuba for the last time, leaving art and manuscripts in a bank vault in Havana. After the 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion, the Finca Vigia was expropriated by the Cuban government, complete with Hemingway's collection of \\\"four to six thousand books\\\".Mellow (1992), 599\\n\\n Idaho and suicide \\nHemingway continued to rework the material that was published as A Moveable Feast through the 1950s. In mid-1959, he visited Spain to research a series of bullfighting articles commissioned by Life magazine.Meyers (1985), 520 Life wanted only 10,000\\u00a0words, but the manuscript grew out of control.Baker (1969), 553 He was unable to organize his writing for the first time in his life, so he asked A. E. Hotchner to travel to Cuba to help him. Hotchner helped him trim the Life piece down to 40,000 words, and Scribner's agreed to a full-length book version (The Dangerous Summer) of almost 130,000 words.Reynolds (1999), 544\\u2013547 Hotchner found Hemingway to be \\\"unusually hesitant, disorganized, and confused\\\",qtd. in Mellow (1992), 598\\u2013600 and suffering badly from failing eyesight.Meyers (1985), 542\\u2013544\\n\\nthumb|Hemingway bird-hunting at Silver Creek, near Picabo, Idaho, January 1959; with him are Gary Cooper and Bobbie Peterson|alt=photograph of two men and woman\\n\\nHemingway and Mary left Cuba for the last time on July 25, 1960. He set up a small office in his New York City apartment and attempted to work, but he left New York for good soon after. He then traveled alone to Spain to be photographed for the front cover of Life magazine. A few days later, the news reported that he was seriously ill and on the verge of dying, which panicked Mary until she received a cable from him telling her, \\\"Reports false. Enroute Madrid. Love Papa.\\\"qtd. in Reynolds (1999), 546 He was, in fact, seriously ill, and believed himself to be on the verge of a breakdown. Feeling lonely, he took to his bed for days, retreating into silence, despite having the first installments of The Dangerous Summer published in Life in September 1960 to good reviews.Mellow (1992), 598\\u2013601 In October, he left Spain for New York, where he refused to leave Mary's apartment, presuming that he was being watched. She quickly took him to Idaho, where physician George Saviers met them at the train.\\n\\nAt this time, Hemingway was constantly worried about money and his safety. He worried about his taxes and that he would never return to Cuba to retrieve the manuscripts that he had left in a bank vault. He became paranoid, thinking that the FBI was actively monitoring his movements in Ketchum.Reynolds (1999), 548Meyers (1985), 543 The FBI had, in fact, opened a file on him during World War II, when he used the Pilar to patrol the waters off Cuba, and J. Edgar Hoover had an agent in Havana watch him during the 1950s.Mellow (1992), 597\\u2013598 By the end of November, Mary was at her wits' end, and Saviers suggested that Hemingway go to the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota; Hemingway might have believed that he was to be treated there for hypertension.  The FBI knew that Hemingway was at the Mayo Clinic, as an agent later documented in a letter written in January 1961.Meyers (1985), 543\\u2013544 He was checked in at the Mayo Clinic under Saviers's name in order to maintain anonymity. Meyers writes that \\\"an aura of secrecy surrounds Hemingway's treatment at the Mayo\\\" but confirms that he was treated with electroconvulsive therapy as many as 15 times in December 1960 and was \\\"released in ruins\\\" in January 1961.Meyers (1985), 547\\u2013550\\n\\nHemingway was back in Ketchum in April 1961, three months after being released from the Mayo Clinic, when Mary \\\"found Hemingway holding a shotgun\\\" in the kitchen one morning. She called Saviers, who sedated him and admitted him to the Sun Valley Hospital; from there he was returned to the Mayo for more electroshock treatments.Meyers (1985), 551 He was released in late June and arrived home in Ketchum on June 30; he then \\\"quite deliberately\\\" shot himself with his favorite shotgun in the early morning hours of July 2, 1961.Reynolds (2000), 16 He had unlocked the basement storeroom where his guns were kept, gone upstairs to the front entrance foyer, and shot himself with the \\\"double-barreled shotgun that he had used so often it might have been a friend\\\".Mellow (1992), 604\\n\\nMary called the Sun Valley Hospital, and a doctor quickly arrived at the house, determinimg that Hemingway \\\"had died of a self-inflicted wound to the head\\\". Mary was sedated and taken to the hospital, returning home the next day where she cleaned the house and saw to the funeral and travel arrangements. Bernice Kert writes that it \\\"did not seem to her a conscious lie\\\" when she told the press that his death had been accidental.Kert (1983), 504 In a press interview five years later, Mary confirmed that he had shot himself.\\n\\nthumb|Hemingway Memorial, Sun Valley, Idaho\\n\\nFamily and friends flew to Ketchum for the funeral, officiated by the local Catholic priest, who believed that the death had been accidental. An altar boy fainted at the head of the casket during the funeral, and Hemingway's brother Leicester wrote: \\\"It seemed to me Ernest would have approved of it all.\\\"Hemingway (1996), 14\\u201318 He is buried in the Ketchum cemetery.Wilson, Scott.

It is a truly gripping story, told in a lean, hard, athletic narrative prose that puts more literary English to shame.\\\"\\\"The Sun Also Rises\\\". (October 31, 1926). The New York Times. Retrieved November 30, 2011. The Sun Also Rises is written in the spare, tight prose that made Hemingway famous, and, according to James Nagel, \\\"changed the nature of American writing.\\\"Nagel (1996), 87 In 1954, when Hemingway was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, it was for \\\"his mastery of the art of narrative, most recently demonstrated in The Old Man and the Sea, and for the influence that he has exerted on contemporary style.\\\"\\n\\nHenry Louis Gates believes Hemingway's style was fundamentally shaped \\\"in reaction to [his] experience of world war\\\". After World War\\u00a0I, he and other modernists \\\"lost faith in the central institutions of Western civilization\\\" by reacting against the elaborate style of 19th-century writers and by creating a style \\\"in which meaning is established through dialogue, through action, and silences\\u2014a fiction in which nothing crucial\\u2014or at least very little\\u2014is stated explicitly.\\\"\\n\\nBecause he began as a writer of short stories, Baker believes Hemingway learned to \\\"get the most from the least, how to prune language, how to multiply intensities and how to tell nothing but the truth in a way that allowed for telling more than the truth.\\\"Baker (1972),  117 Hemingway called his style the iceberg theory: the facts float above water; the supporting structure and symbolism operate out of sight. The concept of the iceberg theory is sometimes referred to as the \\\"theory of omission\\\". Hemingway believed the writer could describe one thing (such as Nick Adams fishing in \\\"The Big Two-Hearted River\\\") though an entirely different thing occurs below the surface (Nick Adams concentrating on fishing to the extent that he does not have to think about anything else).Oliver (1999), 321\\u2013322  Paul Smith writes that Hemingway's first stories, collected as In Our Time, showed he was still experimenting with his writing style.Smith (1996), 45 He avoided complicated syntax. About 70 percent of the sentences are simple sentences\\u2014a childlike syntax without subordination.Wells (1975), 130\\u2013133\\n\\nJackson Benson believes Hemingway used autobiographical details as framing devices about life in general\\u2014not only about his life. For example, Benson postulates that Hemingway used his experiences and drew them out with \\\"what if\\\" scenarios: \\\"what if I were wounded in such a way that I could not sleep at night? What if I were wounded and made crazy, what would happen if I were sent back to the front?\\\"Benson (1989), 351  Writing in \\\"The Art of the Short Story\\\", Hemingway explains: \\\"A few things I have found to be true. If you leave out important things or events that you know about, the story is strengthened. If you leave or skip something because you do not know it, the story will be worthless. The test of any story is how very good the stuff that you, not your editors, omit.\\\"Hemingway (1975), 3\\n\\nThe simplicity of the prose is deceptive. Zoe Trodd believes Hemingway crafted skeletal sentences in response to Henry James's observation that World War\\u00a0I had \\\"used up words\\\". Hemingway offers a \\\"multi-focal\\\" photographic reality. His iceberg theory of omission is the foundation on which he builds. The syntax, which lacks subordinating conjunctions, creates static sentences. The photographic \\\"snapshot\\\" style creates a collage of images. Many types of internal punctuation (colons, semicolons, dashes, parentheses) are omitted in favor of short declarative sentences. The sentences build on each other, as events build to create a sense of the whole. Multiple strands exist in one story; an \\\"embedded text\\\" bridges to a different angle. He also uses other cinematic techniques of \\\"cutting\\\" quickly from one scene to the next; or of \\\"splicing\\\" a scene into another. Intentional omissions allow the reader to fill the gap, as though responding to instructions from the author, and create three-dimensional prose.Trodd (2007), 8\\n\\nHemingway habitually used the word \\\"and\\\" in place of commas. This use of polysyndeton may serve to convey immediacy. Hemingway's polysyndetonic sentence\\u2014or in later works his use of subordinate clauses\\u2014uses conjunctions to juxtapose startling visions and images.  Benson compares them to haikus.McCormick, 49Benson 1989, 309 Many of Hemingway's followers misinterpreted his lead and frowned upon all expression of emotion; Saul Bellow satirized this style as \\\"Do you have emotions? Strangle them.\\\"qtd. in Hoberek (2005), 309 However, Hemingway's intent was not to eliminate emotion, but to portray it more scientifically. Hemingway thought it would be easy, and pointless, to describe emotions; he sculpted collages of images in order to grasp \\\"the real thing, the sequence of motion and fact which made the emotion and which would be as valid in a year or in ten years or, with luck and if you stated it purely enough, always\\\".Hemingway, Ernest. Death in the Afternoon. New York: Simon and Schuster This use of an image as an objective correlative is characteristic of Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot, James Joyce, and Proust.McCormick, 47 Hemingway's letters refer to Proust's Remembrance of Things Past several times over the years, and indicate he read the book at least twice.Burwell (1996), 187\\n\\n Themes \\nThe popularity of Hemingway's work depends on its themes of love, war, wilderness, and loss, all of which are strongly evident in the body of work.Svoboda (2000), 155 These are recurring themes in American literature, and are quite clearly evident in Hemingway's work. Critic Leslie Fiedler sees the theme he defines as \\\"The Sacred Land\\\"\\u2014the American West\\u2014extended in Hemingway's work to include mountains in Spain, Switzerland and Africa, and to the streams of Michigan. The American West is given a symbolic nod with the naming of the \\\"Hotel Montana\\\" in The Sun Also Rises and For Whom the Bell Tolls.  According to Stoltzfus and Fiedler, in Hemingway's work, nature is a place for rebirth and rest; and it is where the hunter or fisherman might experience a moment of transcendence at the moment they kill their prey. Nature is where men exist without women: men fish; men hunt; men find redemption in nature. Although Hemingway does write about sports, such as fishing, Carlos Baker notes the emphasis is more on the athlete than the sport.Baker (1972), 101\\u2013121 At its core, much of Hemingway's work can be viewed in the light of American naturalism, evident in detailed descriptions such as those in \\\"Big Two-Hearted River\\\".\\n\\nFiedler believes Hemingway inverts the American literary theme of the evil \\\"Dark Woman\\\" versus the good \\\"Light Woman\\\". The dark woman\\u2014Brett Ashley of The Sun Also Rises\\u2014is a goddess; the light woman\\u2014Margot Macomber of \\\"The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber\\\"\\u2014is a murderess.Fiedler (1975), 345\\u2013365 Robert Scholes admits that early Hemingway stories, such as \\\"A Very Short Story\\\", present \\\"a male character favorably and a female unfavorably\\\".Scholes (1990),  42  According to Rena Sanderson, early Hemingway critics lauded his male-centric world of masculine pursuits, and the fiction divided women into \\\"castrators or love-slaves\\\". Feminist critics attacked Hemingway as \\\"public enemy number one\\\", although more recent re-evaluations of his work \\\"have given new visibility to Hemingway's female characters (and their strengths) and have revealed his own sensitivity to gender issues, thus casting doubts on the old assumption that his writings were one-sidedly masculine.\\\"Sanderson (1996), 171 Nina Baym believes that Brett Ashley and Margot Macomber \\\"are the two outstanding examples of Hemingway's 'bitch women.Baym (1990), 112\\n\\nThe theme of women and death is evident in stories as early as \\\"Indian Camp\\\". The theme of death permeates Hemingway's work. Young believes the emphasis in \\\"Indian Camp\\\" was not so much on the woman who gives birth or the father who kills himself, but on Nick Adams who witnesses these events as a child, and becomes a \\\"badly scarred and nervous young man\\\". Hemingway sets the events in \\\"Indian Camp\\\" that shape the Adams persona. Young believes \\\"Indian Camp\\\" holds the \\\"master key\\\" to \\\"what its author was up to for some thirty-five years of his writing career\\\".Young (1964), 6 Stoltzfus considers Hemingway's work to be more complex with a representation of the truth inherent in existentialism: if \\\"nothingness\\\" is embraced, then redemption is achieved at the moment of death. Those who face death with dignity and courage live an authentic life. Francis Macomber dies happy because the last hours of his life are authentic; the bullfighter in the corrida represents the pinnacle of a life lived with authenticity.Stoltzfus (2005), 215\\u2013218 In his paper The Uses of Authenticity: Hemingway and the Literary Field, Timo M\\u00fcller writes that Hemingway's fiction is successful because the characters live an \\\"authentic life\\\", and the \\\"soldiers, fishers, boxers and backwoodsmen are among the archetypes of authenticity in modern literature\\\".M\\u00fcller (2010), 31\\n\\nThe theme of emasculation is prevalent in Hemingway's work, most notably in The Sun Also Rises. Emasculation, according to Fiedler, is a result of a generation of wounded soldiers; and of a generation in which women such as Brett gained emancipation. This also applies to the minor character, Frances Clyne, Cohn's girlfriend in the beginning in the book. Her character supports the theme not only because the idea was presented early on in the novel but also the impact she had on Cohn in the start of the book while only appearing a small number of times. Baker believes Hemingway's work emphasizes the \\\"natural\\\" versus the \\\"unnatural\\\". In \\\"Alpine Idyll\\\" the \\\"unnaturalness\\\" of skiing in the high country late spring snow is juxtaposed against the \\\"unnaturalness\\\" of the peasant who allowed his wife's dead body to linger too long in the shed during the winter. The skiers and peasant retreat to the valley to the \\\"natural\\\" spring for redemption.\\n\\nSusan Beegel has written that some more recent critics\\u2014writing through the lens of a more modern social and cultural context several decades after Hemingway's death, and more than half a century after his novels were first published\\u2014have characterized the social era portrayed in his fiction as misogynistic and homophobic.Beegel (1996), 282 In her 1996 essay, \\\"Critical Reception\\\", Beegel analyzed four decades of Hemingway criticism and found that \\\"critics interested in multiculturalism\\\", particularly in the 1980s, simply ignored Hemingway, although some \\\"apologetics\\\" have been written.Beegel (1996) Typical, according to Beegel, is an analysis of Hemingway's 1926 novel, The Sun Also Rises, in which a critic contended: \\\"Hemingway never lets the reader forget that Cohn is a Jew, not an unattractive character who happens to be a Jew but a character who is unattractive because he is a Jew.\\\" Also during the 1980s, according to Beegel, criticism was published that focused on investigating the \\\"horror of homosexuality\\\" and the \\\"racism\\\" typical of the social era portrayed in Hemingway's fiction. In an overall assessment of Hemingway's work Beegel has written: \\\"Throughout his remarkable body of fiction, he tells the truth about human fear, guilt, betrayal, violence, cruelty, drunkenness, hunger, greed, apathy, ecstasy, tenderness, love and lust.\\\"\\n\\n Influence and legacy \\nthumb|Life-sized statue of Hemingway by Jos\\u00e9 Villa Sober\\u00f3n, at El Floridita bar in Havana\\nHemingway's legacy to American literature is his style: writers who came after him emulated it or avoided it.Oliver (1999), 140\\u2013141 After his reputation was established with the publication of The Sun Also Rises, he became the spokesperson for the post-World War\\u00a0I generation, having established a style to follow. His books were burned in Berlin in 1933, \\\"as being a monument of modern decadence\\\", and disavowed by his parents as \\\"filth\\\".Hallengren, Anders. \\\"A Case of Identity: Ernest Hemingway\\\" . Nobelprize.org. Retrieved November 30, 2011. Reynolds asserts the legacy is that \\\"[Hemingway] left stories and novels so starkly moving that some have become part of our cultural heritage.\\\"Reynolds (2000), 15\\n\\nBenson believes the details of Hemingway's life have become a \\\"prime vehicle for exploitation\\\", resulting in a Hemingway industry.Benson (1989), 347 Hemingway scholar Hallengren believes the \\\"hard boiled style\\\" and the machismo must be separated from the author himself. Benson agrees, describing him as introverted and private as J. D. Salinger, although Hemingway masked his nature with braggadocio.Benson (1989), 349 During World War\\u00a0II, Salinger met and corresponded with Hemingway, whom he acknowledged as an influence.  In a letter to Hemingway, Salinger claimed their talks \\\"had given him his only hopeful minutes of the entire war\\\" and jokingly \\\"named himself national chairman of the Hemingway Fan Clubs.\\\"Baker (1969), 420\\n\\nThe extent of Hemingway's influence is seen in the tributes and echoes of his fiction in popular culture. A minor planet, discovered in 1978 by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Chernykh, was named for him (3656 Hemingway);Schmadel, Lutz D. (2003) Dictionary of Minor Planet Names. New York: Springer Verlag. , 307 Ray Bradbury wrote The Kilimanjaro Device, with Hemingway transported to the top of Mount Kilimanjaro; the 1993 motion picture Wrestling Ernest Hemingway, about the friendship of two retired men, Irish and Cuban, in a seaside town in Florida, starred Robert Duvall, Richard Harris, Shirley MacLaine, Sandra Bullock, and Piper Laurie.Oliver (1999), 360 The influence is evident with the many restaurants named \\\"Hemingway\\\"; and the proliferation of bars called \\\"Harry's\\\" (a nod to the bar in Across the River and Into the Trees).Oliver (1999), 142 A line of Hemingway furniture, promoted by Hemingway's son Jack (Bumby), has pieces such as the \\\"Kilimanjaro\\\" bedside table, and a \\\"Catherine\\\" slip-covered sofa. Montblanc offers a Hemingway fountain pen, and a line of Hemingway safari clothes has been created. The International Imitation Hemingway Competition was created in 1977 to publicly acknowledge his influence and the comically misplaced efforts of lesser authors to imitate his style. Entrants are encouraged to submit one \\\"really good page of really bad Hemingway\\\" and winners are flown to Italy to Harry's Bar.\\n\\nIn 1965, Mary Hemingway established the Hemingway Foundation and in the 1970s she donated her husband's papers to the John F. Kennedy Library. In 1980, a group of Hemingway scholars gathered to assess the donated papers, subsequently forming the Hemingway Society, \\\"committed to supporting and fostering Hemingway scholarship\\\".Miller (2006), 78\\u201380\\n\\nAlmost exactly 35 years after Hemingway's death, on July 1, 1996, his granddaughter Margaux Hemingway died in Santa Monica, California. Margaux was a supermodel and actress, co-starring with her younger sister Mariel in the 1976 movie Lipstick.\\\"Margaux Hemingway Is Dead; Model and Actress Was 41\\\". (July 3, 1996).

Retrieved May 14, 2010.\\n\\nThree houses associated with Hemingway are listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places:  the Ernest Hemingway Cottage on Walloon Lake, Michigan, designated in 1968; the Ernest Hemingway House in Key West, designated in 1968; and the Ernest and Mary Hemingway House in Ketchum, designated in 2015. His boyhood home, in Oak Park, Illinois, is a museum and archive dedicated to Hemingway.
