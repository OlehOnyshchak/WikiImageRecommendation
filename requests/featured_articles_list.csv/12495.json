"{\"title\": \"Grover Cleveland\", \"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover_Cleveland\", \"text\": \"Stephen Grover Cleveland (March 18, 1837 \\u2013 June 24, 1908) was an American politician and lawyer who was the 22nd and 24th president of the United States, the only president in American history to serve two non-consecutive terms in office (1885\\u20131889 and 1893\\u20131897). He won the popular vote for three presidential elections\\u2014in 1884, 1888, and 1892\\u2014and was one of two Democrats (with Woodrow Wilson) to be elected president during the era of Republican political domination dating from 1861 to 1933.\\n\\nCleveland was the leader of the pro-business Bourbon Democrats who opposed high tariffs, Free Silver, inflation, imperialism, and subsidies to business, farmers, or veterans. His crusade for political reform and fiscal conservatism made him an icon for American conservatives of the era.Blum, 527 Cleveland won praise for his honesty, self-reliance, integrity, and commitment to the principles of classical liberalism.Jeffers, 8\\u201312; Nevins, 4\\u20135; Beito and Beito He fought political corruption, patronage, and bossism. As a reformer, Cleveland had such prestige that the like-minded wing of the Republican Party, called \\\"Mugwumps\\\", largely bolted the GOP presidential ticket and swung to his support in the 1884 election.McFarland, 11\\u201356\\n\\nAs his second administration began, disaster hit the nation when the Panic of 1893 produced a severe national depression, which Cleveland was unable to reverse. It ruined his Democratic Party, opening the way for a Republican landslide in 1894 and for the agrarian and silverite seizure of the Democratic Party in 1896. The result was a political realignment that ended the Third Party System and launched the Fourth Party System and the Progressive Era.Gould, passim\\n\\nCleveland was a formidable policymaker, and he also drew corresponding criticism. His intervention in the Pullman Strike of 1894 to keep the railroads moving angered labor unions nationwide in addition to the party in Illinois; his support of the gold standard and opposition to Free Silver alienated the agrarian wing of the Democratic Party.Tugwell, 220\\u2013249 Critics complained that Cleveland had little imagination and seemed overwhelmed by the nation's economic disasters\\u2014depressions and strikes\\u2014in his second term. Even so, his reputation for probity and good character survived the troubles of his second term. Biographer Allan Nevins wrote, \\\"[I]n Grover Cleveland, the greatness lies in typical rather than unusual qualities. He had no endowments that thousands of men do not have. He possessed honesty, courage, firmness, independence, and common sense. But he possessed them to a degree other men do not.\\\"Nevins, 4 By the end of his second term, public perception showed him to be one of the most unpopular U.S. presidents, and he was by then rejected even by most Democrats.President-Making in the Gilded Age: The Nominating Conventions of 1876\\u20131900 by Stan M. Haynes page 2 Today, Cleveland is considered by most historians to have been a successful leader, generally ranked among the upper-mid tier of American presidents.\\n\\nEarly life\\n\\nChildhood and family history\\nthumb|Caldwell Presbyterian parsonage, birthplace of Grover Cleveland in Caldwell, New Jersey\\nStephen Grover Cleveland was born on March 18, 1837, in Caldwell, New Jersey, to Ann (n\\u00e9e Neal) and Richard Falley Cleveland.Nevins, 8\\u201310 Cleveland's father was a Congregational and Presbyterian minister who was originally from Connecticut.Graff, 3\\u20134; Nevins, 8\\u201310 His mother was from Baltimore and was the daughter of a bookseller.Graff, 3\\u20134 On his father's side, Cleveland was descended from English ancestors, the first of the family having emigrated to Massachusetts from Cleveland, England in 1635.Nevins, 6 His father's maternal grandfather, Richard Falley Jr., fought at the Battle of Bunker Hill, and was the son of an immigrant from Guernsey. On his mother's side, Cleveland was descended from Anglo-Irish Protestants and German Quakers from Philadelphia.Nevins, 9 Cleveland was distantly related to General Moses Cleaveland, after whom the city of Cleveland, Ohio, was named.Graff, 7\\n\\nCleveland, the fifth of nine children, was named Stephen Grover in honor of the first pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of Caldwell, where his father was pastor at the time. He became known as Grover in his adult life.Nevins, 10; Graff, 3 In 1841, the Cleveland family moved to Fayetteville, New York, where Grover spent much of his childhood.Nevins, 11; Graff, 8\\u20139 Neighbors later described him as \\\"full of fun and inclined to play pranks,\\\"Nevins, 11 and fond of outdoor sports.Jeffers, 17\\n\\nIn 1850, Cleveland's father moved to Clinton, New York, to work as district secretary for the American Home Missionary Society.Nevins, 17\\u201319 Despite his father's dedication to his missionary work, the income was insufficient for the large family. Financial conditions forced him to remove Grover from school into a two-year mercantile apprenticeship in Fayetteville. The experience was valuable and brief, and the living conditions quite austere. Grover returned to Clinton and his schooling at the completion of the apprentice contract.Tugwell, 14 In 1853, when missionary work began to take a toll on his health, Cleveland's father took an assignment in Holland Patent, New York (near Utica) and the family moved again.Nevins, 21 Shortly after, he died from a gastric ulcer, with Grover reputedly hearing of his father's death from a boy selling newspapers.\\n\\nEducation and moving west\\nthumb|upright|An early, undated photograph of Grover Cleveland\\nCleveland received his elementary education at the Fayetteville Academy and the Clinton Liberal Academy.Nevins, 18\\u201319; Jeffers, 19 After his father died in 1853, he again left school to help support his family. Later that year, Cleveland's brother William was hired as a teacher at the New York Institute for the Blind in New York City, and William obtained a place for Cleveland as an assistant teacher. He returned home to Holland Patent at the end of 1854, where an elder in his church offered to pay for his college education if he would promise to become a minister. Cleveland declined, and in 1855 he decided to move west.Nevins, 23\\u201327 He stopped first in Buffalo, New York, where his uncle, Lewis F. Allen, gave him a clerical job.Nevins, 27\\u201333 Allen was an important man in Buffalo, and he introduced his nephew to influential men there, including the partners in the law firm of Rogers, Bowen, and Rogers.Nevins, 31\\u201336 Millard Fillmore, the 13th president of the United States, had previously worked for the partnership.Graff, 11 Cleveland later took a clerkship with the firm, began to read the law, and was admitted to the New York bar in 1859.Graff, 14\\n\\nEarly career and the Civil War\\nCleveland worked for the Rogers firm for three years, then left in 1862 to start his own practice.Graff, 14\\u201315 In January 1863, he was appointed assistant district attorney of Erie County.Graff, 15; Nevins, 46 With the American Civil War raging, Congress passed the Conscription Act of 1863, requiring able-bodied men to serve in the army if called upon, or else to hire a substitute. Cleveland chose the latter course, paying $150 () to George Benninsky, a thirty-two-year-old Polish immigrant, to serve in his place.Graff, 14; Nevins, 51\\u201352 Benninsky survived the war.Graff, 14\\n\\nAs a lawyer, Cleveland became known for his single-minded concentration and dedication to hard work.Nevins, 52\\u201353 In 1866, he successfully defended some participants in the Fenian raid, working on a pro bono basis (free of charge).Nevins, 54 In 1868, Cleveland attracted professional attention for his winning defense of a libel suit against the editor of Buffalo's Commercial Advertiser.Nevins, 54\\u201355 During this time, Cleveland assumed a lifestyle of simplicity, taking residence in a plain boarding house; Cleveland dedicated his growing income instead to the support of his mother and younger sisters.Nevins, 55\\u201356 While his personal quarters were austere, Cleveland enjoyed an active social life and \\\"the easy-going sociability of hotel-lobbies and saloons.\\\"Nevins, 56 He shunned the circles of higher society of Buffalo in which his uncle's family traveled.Tugwell, 26\\n\\nPolitical career in New York\\n\\nSheriff of Erie County\\nupright|thumb|Statue of Grover Cleveland outside City Hall in Buffalo, New York\\nFrom his earliest involvement in politics, Cleveland aligned with the Democratic Party.Nevins, 44\\u201345 He had a decided aversion to Republicans John Fremont and Abraham Lincoln, and the heads of the Rogers law firm were solid Democrats.Tugwell, 32 In 1865, he ran for District Attorney, losing narrowly to his friend and roommate, Lyman K. Bass, the Republican nominee. In 1870, with the help of friend Oscar Folsom, Cleveland secured the Democratic nomination for Sheriff of Erie County, New York.Nevins, 58 He won the election by a 303-vote margin and took office on January 1, 1871 at age 33.Jeffers, 33 While this new career took him away from the practice of law, it was rewarding in other ways: the fees were said to yield up to $40,000 () over the two-year term.\\n\\nCleveland's service as sheriff was unremarkable; biographer Rexford Tugwell described the time in office as a waste for Cleveland politically. Cleveland was aware of graft in the sheriff's office during his tenure and chose not to confront it.Tugwell, 36 A notable incident of his term took place on September 6, 1872, when Patrick Morrissey was executed, who had been convicted of murdering his mother.Jeffers, 34; Nevins, 61\\u201362 As sheriff, Cleveland was responsible for either personally carrying out the execution or paying a deputy $10 to perform the task. In spite of reservations about the hanging, Cleveland executed Morrissey himself. He hanged another murderer, John Gaffney, on February 14, 1873.\\n\\nAfter his term as sheriff ended, Cleveland returned to his law practice, opening a firm with his friends Lyman K. Bass and Wilson S. Bissell.Jeffers, 36; Nevins, 64 Elected to Congress in 1872, Bass did not spend much time at the firm, but Cleveland and Bissell soon rose to the top of Buffalo's legal community.Nevins, 66\\u201371 Up to that point, Cleveland's political career had been honorable and unexceptional. As biographer Allan Nevins wrote, \\\"Probably no man in the country, on March 4, 1881, had less thought than this limited, simple, sturdy attorney of Buffalo that four years later he would be standing in Washington and taking the oath as President of the United States.\\\"Nevins, 78\\n\\nIt was during this period that Cleveland began courting a widow, Maria Halpin. She later accused him of raping her. He accused her of being an alcoholic and consorting with men. In an attempt to discredit her, he had her institutionalized, and their child taken away and raised by his friends. The institution quickly realized that she did not belong there, and released her.https://www.thedailybeast.com/grover-clevelands-sex-scandal-the-most-despicable-in-american-political-history The illegitimate child became a campaign issue for the GOP in his first presidential campaign.\\n\\nMayor of Buffalo\\nIn the 1870s, the municipal government in Buffalo had grown increasingly corrupt, with Democratic and Republican political machines cooperating to share the spoils of political office.Nevins, 79; Graff, 18\\u201319; Jeffers, 42\\u201345; Welch, 24 In 1881 the Republicans nominated a slate of particularly disreputable machine politicians; the Democrats saw the opportunity to gain the votes of disaffected Republicans by nominating a more honest candidate.Nevins, 79\\u201380; Graff, 18\\u201319; Welch, 24 The party leaders approached Cleveland, and he agreed to run for Mayor of Buffalo, provided that the rest of the ticket was to his liking.Nevins, 80\\u201381 When the more notorious politicians were left off the Democratic ticket, Cleveland accepted the nomination. Cleveland was elected mayor with 15,120 votes, as against 11,528 for Milton C. Beebe, his opponent.Nevins, 83 He took office January 2, 1882.\\n\\nCleveland's term as mayor was spent fighting the entrenched interests of the party machines.Graff, 19; Jeffers, 46\\u201350 Among the acts that established his reputation was a veto of the street-cleaning bill passed by the Common Council.Nevins, 84\\u201386 The street-cleaning contract was open for bids, and the Council selected the highest bidder at $422,000, rather than the lowest of $100,000 less, because of the political connections of the bidder. While this sort of bipartisan graft had previously been tolerated in Buffalo, Mayor Cleveland would have none of it. His veto message said, \\\"I regard it as the culmination of a most bare-faced, impudent, and shameless scheme to betray the interests of the people, and to worse than squander the public money.\\\"Nevins, 85 The Council reversed itself and awarded the contract to the lowest bidder.Nevins, 86 Cleveland also asked the state legislature to form a Commission to develop a plan to improve the sewer system in Buffalo at a much lower cost than previously proposed locally; this plan was successfully adopted.Tugwell, 58 For this, and other actions safeguarding public funds, Cleveland's reputation as a leader willing to purge government corruption began to spread beyond Erie County.Nevins, 94\\u201395; Jeffers, 50\\u201351\\n\\nGovernor of New York\\nthumb|left|Gubernatorial portrait of Grover Cleveland\\nNew York Democratic party officials began to consider Cleveland a possible nominee for governor.Nevins, 94\\u201399; Graff, 26\\u201327 Daniel Manning, a party insider who admired Cleveland's record, was instrumental in his candidacy.Tugwell, 68\\u201370 With a split in the state Republican party in 1882, the Democratic party was considered to be at an advantage; there were several contenders for that party's nomination. The two leading Democratic candidates were Roswell P. Flower and Henry W. Slocum. Their factions deadlocked, and the convention could not agree on a nominee.Graff, 26; Nevins, 101\\u2013103 Cleveland, in third place on the first ballot, picked up support in subsequent votes and emerged as the compromise choice.Nevins, 103\\u2013104 The Republican party remained divided against itself, and in the general election Cleveland emerged the victor, with 535,318 votes to Republican nominee Charles J. Folger's 342,464.Nevins, 105 Cleveland's margin of victory was, at the time, the largest in a contested New York election; the Democrats also picked up seats in both houses of the New York State Legislature.Graff, 28\\n\\nCleveland brought his opposition to needless spending to the governor's office; he promptly sent the legislature eight vetos in his first two months in office.Graff, 35 The first to attract attention was his veto of a bill to reduce the fares on New York City elevated trains to five cents.Graff, 35\\u201336 The bill had broad support because the trains' owner, Jay Gould, was unpopular, and his fare increases were widely denounced.Nevins, 114\\u2013116 Cleveland, however, saw the bill as unjust\\u2014Gould had taken over the railroads when they were failing and had made the system solvent again.Nevins, 116\\u2013117 Moreover, Cleveland believed that altering Gould's franchise would violate the Contract Clause of the federal Constitution. Despite the initial popularity of the fare-reduction bill, the newspapers praised Cleveland's veto. Theodore Roosevelt, then a member of the Assembly, had reluctantly voted for the bill to which Cleveland objected, in a desire to punish the unscrupulous railroad barons.Nevins, 117\\u2013118 After the veto, Roosevelt reversed himself, as did many legislators, and the veto was sustained.\\n\\nCleveland's defiance of political corruption won him popular acclaim, and the enmity of the influential Tammany Hall organization in New York City.Nevins, 125\\u2013126 Tammany, under its boss, John Kelly, had disapproved of Cleveland's nomination as governor, and their resistance intensified after Cleveland openly opposed and prevented the re-election of their point man in the State Senate, Thomas F. Grady.Tugwell, 77 Cleveland also steadfastly opposed nominees of the Tammanyites, as well as bills passed as a result of their deal making.Tugwell, 73 The loss of Tammany's support was offset by the support of Theodore Roosevelt and other reform-minded Republicans who helped Cleveland to pass several laws reforming municipal governments.Nevins, 138\\u2013140\\n\\nElection of 1884\\n\\nNomination for president\\n\\nthumb|An anti-Blaine cartoon presents him as the \\\"tattooed man,\\\" with many indelible scandals.\\nthumb|An anti-Cleveland cartoon highlights the Halpin scandal.\\n\\nThe Republicans convened in Chicago and nominated former Speaker of the House James G. Blaine of Maine for president on the fourth ballot. Blaine's nomination alienated many Republicans who viewed Blaine as ambitious and immoral.Nevins, 185\\u2013186; Jeffers, 96\\u201397 The GOP standard bearer was weakened by alienating the Mugwumps, and the Conkling faction, recently disenfranchised by President Arthur.Tugwell, 88 Democratic party leaders saw the Republicans' choice as an opportunity to win the White House for the first time since 1856 if the right candidate could be found.\\n\\nAmong the Democrats, Samuel J. Tilden was the initial front-runner, having been the party's nominee in the contested election of 1876.Nevins, 146\\u2013147 After Tilden declined a nomination due to his poor health, his supporters shifted to several other contenders. Cleveland was among the leaders in early support, and Thomas F. Bayard of Delaware, Allen G. Thurman of Ohio, Samuel Freeman Miller of Iowa, and Benjamin Butler of Massachusetts also had considerable followings, along with various favorite sons. Each of the other candidates had hindrances to his nomination: Bayard had spoken in favor of secession in 1861, making him unacceptable to Northerners; Butler, conversely, was reviled throughout the South for his actions during the Civil War; Thurman was generally well liked, but was growing old and infirm, and his views on the silver question were uncertain.Nevins, 147 Cleveland, too, had detractors\\u2014Tammany remained opposed to him\\u2014but the nature of his enemies made him still more friends.Nevins, 152\\u2013153; Graff, 51\\u201353 Cleveland led on the first ballot, with 392 votes out of 820.Nevins, 153 On the second ballot, Tammany threw its support behind Butler, but the rest of the delegates shifted to Cleveland, who won.Nevins, 154; Graff, 53\\u201354 Thomas A. Hendricks of Indiana was selected as his running mate.\\n\\nCampaign against Blaine\\nCorruption in politics was the central issue in 1884; indeed, Blaine had over the span of his career been involved in several questionable deals.Tugwell, 80 Cleveland's reputation as an opponent of corruption proved the Democrats' strongest asset.Summers, passim; Grossman, 31 William C. Hudson created Cleveland's contextual campaign slogan \\\"A public office is a public trust.\\\"Tugwell, 84 Reform-minded Republicans called \\\"Mugwumps\\\" denounced Blaine as corrupt and flocked to Cleveland.Nevins, 156\\u2013159; Graff, 55 The Mugwumps, including such men as Carl Schurz and Henry Ward Beecher, were more concerned with morality than with party, and felt Cleveland was a kindred soul who would promote civil service reform and fight for efficiency in government. At the same time the Democrats gained support from the Mugwumps, they lost some blue-collar workers to the Greenback-Labor party, led by ex-Democrat Benjamin Butler.Nevins, 187\\u2013188 In general, Cleveland abided by the precedent of minimizing presidential campaign travel and speechmaking; Blaine became one of the first to break with that tradition.Tugwell, 93\\n\\nThe campaign focused on the candidates' moral standards, as each side cast aspersions on their opponents. Cleveland's supporters rehashed the old allegations that Blaine had corruptly influenced legislation in favor of the Little Rock and Fort Smith Railroad and the Union Pacific Railway, later profiting on the sale of bonds he owned in both companies.Nevins, 159\\u2013162; Graff, 59\\u201360 Although the stories of Blaine's favors to the railroads had made the rounds eight years earlier, this time Blaine's correspondence was discovered, making his earlier denials less plausible. On some of the most damaging correspondence, Blaine had written \\\"Burn this letter\\\", giving Democrats the last line to their rallying cry: \\\"Blaine, Blaine, James G. Blaine, the continental liar from the state of Maine, 'Burn this letter!\\\"Graff, 59; Jeffers, 111; Nevins, 177, Welch, 34\\n\\nRegarding Cleveland, commentator Jeff Jacoby notes that, \\\"Not since George Washington had a candidate for President been so renowned for his rectitude.\\\"Jeff Jacoby, \\\"'Grover the good'\\u2014the most honest president of them all\\\", Boston Globe Feb. 15. 2\\u201315 But the Republicans found a refutation buried in Cleveland's past. Aided by the sermons of Reverend George H. Ball, a minister from Buffalo, they made public the allegation that Cleveland had fathered an illegitimate child while he was a lawyer there, and their rallies soon included the chant \\\"Ma, Ma, where's my Pa?\\\".Tugwell, 90 When confronted with the scandal, Cleveland immediately instructed his supporters to \\\"Above all, tell the truth.\\\" Cleveland admitted to paying child support in 1874 to Maria Crofts Halpin, the woman who asserted he had fathered her son Oscar Folsom Cleveland and he assumed responsibility. Shortly before the 1884 election, the Republican media published an affidavit from Halpin in which she stated that until she met Cleveland, her \\\"life was pure and spotless\\\", and \\\"there is not, and never was, a doubt as to the paternity of our child, and the attempt of Grover Cleveland, or his friends, to couple the name of Oscar Folsom, or any one else, with that boy, for that purpose is simply infamous and false.\\\"\\n\\nthumb|upright=1.35|Results of the 1884 election\\n\\nThe electoral votes of closely contested New York, New Jersey, Indiana, and Connecticut would determine the election.Welch, 33 In New York, the Tammany Democrats decided that they would gain more from supporting a Democrat they disliked than a Republican who would do nothing for them.Nevins, 170\\u2013171 Blaine hoped that he would have more support from Irish Americans than Republicans typically did; while the Irish were mainly a Democratic constituency in the 19th century, Blaine's mother was Irish Catholic, and he had been supportive of the Irish National Land League while he was Secretary of State.Nevins, 170 The Irish, a significant group in three of the swing states, did appear inclined to support Blaine until a Republican, Samuel D. Burchard, gave a speech pivotal for the Democrats, denouncing them as the party of \\\"Rum, Romanism, and Rebellion.\\\"Nevins, 181\\u2013184 The Democrats spread the word of this implied Catholic insult on the eve of the election. They also blistered Blaine for attending a banquet with some of New York City's wealthiest men.Tugwell, 94\\u201395\\n\\nAfter the votes were counted, Cleveland narrowly won all four of the swing states, including New York by 1200 votes.,  While the popular vote total was close, with Cleveland winning by just one-quarter of a percent, the electoral votes gave Cleveland a majority of 219\\u2013182. Following the electoral victory, the \\\"Ma, Ma\\u00a0...\\\" attack phrase gained a classic riposte: \\\"Gone to the White House. Ha! Ha! Ha!\\\"Graff, 64\\n\\nFirst term as president (1885\\u20131889)\\n\\nReform\\nthumb|Cleveland portrayed as a tariff reformer\\n\\nSoon after taking office, Cleveland was faced with the task of filling all the government jobs for which the president had the power of appointment. These jobs were typically filled under the spoils system, but Cleveland announced that he would not fire any Republican who was doing his job well, and would not appoint anyone solely on the basis of party service.Nevins, 208\\u2013211 He also used his appointment powers to reduce the number of federal employees, as many departments had become bloated with political time-servers.Nevins, 214\\u2013217 Later in his term, as his fellow Democrats chafed at being excluded from the spoils, Cleveland began to replace more of the partisan Republican officeholders with Democrats;Graff, 83 this was especially the case with policy making positions.Tugwell, 100 While some of his decisions were influenced by party concerns, more of Cleveland's appointments were decided by merit alone than was the case in his predecessors' administrations.Nevins, 238\\u2013241; Welch, 59\\u201360\\n\\nCleveland also reformed other parts of the government. In 1887, he signed an act creating the Interstate Commerce Commission.Nevins, 354\\u2013357; Graff, 85 He and Secretary of the Navy William C. Whitney undertook to modernize the navy and canceled construction contracts that had resulted in inferior ships.Nevins, 217\\u2013223; Graff, 77 Cleveland angered railroad investors by ordering an investigation of western lands they held by government grant.Nevins, 223\\u2013228 Secretary of the Interior Lucius Q. C. Lamar charged that the rights of way for this land must be returned to the public because the railroads failed to extend their lines according to agreements. The lands were forfeited, resulting in the return of approximately .\\n\\nCleveland was the first Democratic President subject to the Tenure of Office Act which originated in 1867; the act purported to require the Senate to approve the dismissal of any presidential appointee who was originally subject to its advice and consent. Cleveland objected to the act in principle and his steadfast refusal to abide by it prompted its fall into disfavor and led to its ultimate repeal in 1887.Tugwell, 130\\u2013134\\n\\nVetoes\\n\\nCleveland faced a Republican Senate and often resorted to using his veto powers.Graff, 85 He vetoed hundreds of private pension bills for American Civil War veterans, believing that if their pensions requests had already been rejected by the Pension Bureau, Congress should not attempt to override that decision.Nevins, 326\\u2013328; Graff, 83\\u201384 When Congress, pressured by the Grand Army of the Republic, passed a bill granting pensions for disabilities not caused by military service, Cleveland also vetoed that.Nevins, 300\\u2013331; Graff, 83 Cleveland used the veto far more often than any president up to that time.See List of United States presidential vetoes In 1887, Cleveland issued his most well-known veto, that of the Texas Seed Bill.Nevins, 331\\u2013332; Graff, 85 After a drought had ruined crops in several Texas counties, Congress appropriated $10,000 () to purchase seed grain for farmers there. Cleveland vetoed the expenditure. In his veto message, he espoused a theory of limited government:\\n\\nSilver\\nOne of the most volatile issues of the 1880s was whether the currency should be backed by gold and silver, or by gold alone.Jeffers, 157\\u2013158 The issue cut across party lines, with western Republicans and southern Democrats joining together in the call for the free coinage of silver, and both parties' representatives in the northeast holding firm for the gold standard.Nevins, 201\\u2013205; Graff, 102\\u2013103 Because silver was worth less than its legal equivalent in gold, taxpayers paid their government bills in silver, while international creditors demanded payment in gold, resulting in a depletion of the nation's gold supply.\\n\\nCleveland and Treasury Secretary Daniel Manning stood firmly on the side of the gold standard, and tried to reduce the amount of silver that the government was required to coin under the Bland\\u2013Allison Act of 1878.Nevins, 269 Cleveland unsuccessfully appealed to Congress to repeal this law before he was inaugurated.Tugwell, 110 Angered Westerners and Southerners advocated for cheap money to help their poorer constituents.Nevins, 268 In reply, one of the foremost silverites, Richard P. Bland, introduced a bill in 1886 that would require the government to coin unlimited amounts of silver, inflating the then-deflating currency.Nevins, 273 While Bland's bill was defeated, so was a bill the administration favored that would repeal any silver coinage requirement. The result was a retention of the status quo, and a postponement of the resolution of the Free Silver issue.Nevins, 277\\u2013279\\n\\nTariffs\\n\\\"When we consider that the theory of our institutions guarantees to every citizen the full enjoyment of all the fruits of his industry and enterprise, with only such deduction as may be his share toward the careful and economical maintenance of the Government which protects him, it is plain that the exaction of more than this is indefensible extortion and a culpable betrayal of American fairness and justice\\u00a0... The public Treasury, which should only exist as a conduit conveying the people's tribute to its legitimate objects of expenditure, becomes a hoarding place for money needlessly withdrawn from trade and the people's use, thus crippling our national energies, suspending our country's development, preventing investment in productive enterprise, threatening financial disturbance, and inviting schemes of public plunder.\\\" Cleveland's third annual message to Congress,December 6, 1887.\\nAnother contentious financial issue at the time was the protective tariff. These tariffs had been implemented as a temporary measure during the civil war to protect American industrial interests but remained in place after the war.\\\"Grover Cleveland: Key Events\\\" University of Virginia Miller Center, Accessed June 3, 2019. While it had not been a central point in his campaign, Cleveland's opinion on the tariff was that of most Democrats: that the tariff ought to be reduced.Nevins, 280\\u2013282, Reitano, 46\\u201362 Republicans generally favored a high tariff to protect American industries. American tariffs had been high since the Civil War, and by the 1880s the tariff brought in so much revenue that the government was running a surplus.Nevins, 286\\u2013287\\n\\nIn 1886, a bill to reduce the tariff was narrowly defeated in the House.Nevins, 287\\u2013288 The tariff issue was emphasized in the Congressional elections that year, and the forces of protectionism increased their numbers in the Congress, but Cleveland continued to advocate tariff reform.Nevins, 290\\u2013296; Graff, 87\\u201388 As the surplus grew, Cleveland and the reformers called for a tariff for revenue only.Nevins, 370\\u2013371 His message to Congress in 1887 (quoted at right) highlighted the injustice of taking more money from the people than the government needed to pay its operating expenses.Nevins, 379\\u2013381 Republicans, as well as protectionist northern Democrats like Samuel J. Randall, believed that American industries would fail without high tariffs, and they continued to fight reform efforts.Nevins, 383\\u2013385 Roger Q. Mills, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, proposed a bill to reduce the tariff from about 47% to about 40%.Graff, 88\\u201389 After significant exertions by Cleveland and his allies, the bill passed the House. The Republican Senate failed to come to agreement with the Democratic House, and the bill died in the conference committee. Dispute over the tariff persisted into the 1888 presidential election.\\n\\nForeign policy, 1885\\u20131889\\nCleveland was a committed non-interventionist who had campaigned in opposition to expansion and imperialism. He refused to promote the previous administration's Nicaragua canal treaty, and generally was less of an expansionist in foreign relations.Nevins, 205, 404\\u2013405 Cleveland's Secretary of State, Thomas F. Bayard, negotiated with Joseph Chamberlain of the United Kingdom over fishing rights in the waters off Canada, and struck a conciliatory note, despite the opposition of New England's Republican Senators.Nevins, 404\\u2013413 Cleveland also withdrew from Senate consideration the Berlin Conference treaty which guaranteed an open door for U.S. interests in the Congo.Zakaria, 80\\n\\nMilitary policy, 1885\\u20131889\\nCleveland's military policy emphasized self-defense and modernization. In 1885 Cleveland appointed the Board of Fortifications under Secretary of War William C. Endicott to recommend a new coastal fortification system for the United States.Berhow, pp. 9\\u201310Endicott and Taft Boards at the Coast Defense Study Group website  No improvements to US coastal defenses had been made since the late 1870s.Berhow, p. 8Civil War and 1870s defenses at the Coast Defense Study Group website  The Board's 1886 report recommended a massive $127 million construction program (equivalent to $\\u00a0billion in ) at 29 harbors and river estuaries, to include new breech-loading rifled guns, mortars, and naval minefields. The Board and the program are usually called the Endicott Board and the Endicott Program. Most of the Board's recommendations were implemented, and by 1910, 27 locations were defended by over 70 forts.Berhow, pp. 201\\u2013226List of all US coastal forts and batteries at the Coast Defense Study Group website Many of the weapons remained in place until scrapped in World War II as they were replaced with new defenses. Endicott also proposed to Congress a system of examinations for Army officer promotions.William Crowninshield Endicott, from Bell, William Gardner (1992), Secretaries of War and Secretaries of the Army, Center of Military History, US Army For the Navy, the Cleveland administration spearheaded by Secretary of the Navy William Collins Whitney moved towards modernization, although no ships were constructed that could match the best European warships. Although completion of the four steel-hulled warships begun under the previous administration was delayed due to a corruption investigation and subsequent bankruptcy of their building yard, these ships were completed in a timely manner in naval shipyards once the investigation was over.Bauer and Roberts, p. 141 Sixteen additional steel-hulled warships were ordered by the end of 1888; these ships later proved vital in the Spanish\\u2013American War of 1898, and many served in World War I. These ships included the \\\"second-class battleships\\\"  and , designed to match modern armored ships recently acquired by South American countries from Europe, such as the Brazilian battleship Riachuelo.Bauer and Roberts, p. 102 Eleven protected cruisers (including the famous ), one armored cruiser, and one monitor were also ordered, along with the experimental cruiser .Bauer and Roberts, pp. 101, 133, 141\\u2013147\\n\\nCivil rights and immigration\\nCleveland, like a growing number of Northerners (and nearly all white Southerners) saw Reconstruction as a failed experiment, and was reluctant to use federal power to enforce the 15th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which guaranteed voting rights to African Americans.Welch, 65\\u201366 Though Cleveland appointed no black Americans to patronage jobs, he allowed Frederick Douglass to continue in his post as recorder of deeds in Washington, D.C. and appointed another black man (James Campbell Matthews, a former New York judge) to replace Douglass upon his resignation. His decision to replace Douglass with a black man was met with outrage, but Cleveland claimed to have known Matthews personally.\\n\\nAlthough Cleveland had condemned the \\\"outrages\\\" against Chinese immigrants, he believed that Chinese immigrants were unwilling to assimilate into white society.Welch, 72 Secretary of State Thomas F. Bayard negotiated an extension to the Chinese Exclusion Act, and Cleveland lobbied the Congress to pass the Scott Act, written by Congressman William Lawrence Scott, which prevented the return of Chinese immigrants who left the United States.Welch, 73 The Scott Act easily passed both houses of Congress, and Cleveland signed it into law on October 1, 1888.\\n\\nNative American policy\\nthumb|left|upright|Henry L. Dawes wrote the Dawes Act, which Cleveland signed into law.\\n\\nCleveland viewed Native Americans as wards of the state, saying in his first inaugural address that \\\"[t]his guardianship involves, on our part, efforts for the improvement of their condition and enforcement of their rights.\\\"Welch, 70; Nevins, 358\\u2013359 He encouraged the idea of cultural assimilation, pushing for the passage of the Dawes Act, which provided for distribution of Indian lands to individual members of tribes, rather than having them continued to be held in trust for the tribes by the federal government. While a conference of Native leaders endorsed the act, in practice the majority of Native Americans disapproved of it.Graff, 206\\u2013207 Cleveland believed the Dawes Act would lift Native Americans out of poverty and encourage their assimilation into white society. It ultimately weakened the tribal governments and allowed individual Indians to sell land and keep the money.\\n\\nIn the month before Cleveland's 1885 inauguration, President Arthur opened four million acres of Winnebago and Crow Creek Indian lands in the Dakota Territory to white settlement by executive order.Brodsky, 141\\u2013142; Nevins, 228\\u2013229 Tens of thousands of settlers gathered at the border of these lands and prepared to take possession of them. Cleveland believed Arthur's order to be in violation of treaties with the tribes, and rescinded it on April 17 of that year, ordering the settlers out of the territory. Cleveland sent in eighteen companies of Army troops to enforce the treaties and ordered General Philip Sheridan, at the time Commanding General of the U. S. Army, to investigate the matter.\\n\\nMarriage and children\\nthumb|upright=0.9|right|Frances Folsom Cleveland circa 1886\\nCleveland was 47 when he entered the White House as a bachelor, and his sister Rose Cleveland joined him, to act as hostess for the first two years of his administration.Brodsky, 158; Jeffers, 149 Unlike the previous bachelor president James Buchanan, Cleveland did not remain a bachelor for long. In 1885 the daughter of Cleveland's friend Oscar Folsom visited him in Washington.Graff, 78 Frances Folsom was a student at Wells College. When she returned to school, President Cleveland received her mother's permission to correspond with her, and they were soon engaged to be married. On June 2, 1886, Cleveland was 49 when he married Frances Folsom (21) in the Blue Room at the White House.Graff, 79 He was the second president to wed while in office,John Tyler, who married his second wife Julia Gardiner in 1844, was the first and has been the only president to marry in the White House. This marriage was unusual because Cleveland was the executor of Oscar Folsom's estate and had supervised Frances's upbringing after her father's death; nevertheless, the public took no exception to the match.Jeffers, 170\\u2013176; Graff, 78\\u201381; Nevins, 302\\u2013308; Welch, 51 At 21 years, Frances Folsom Cleveland was the youngest First Lady in history, and the public soon warmed to her warm personality.Graff, 80\\u201381\\n\\nThe Clevelands had five children: Ruth (1891\\u20131904), Esther (1893\\u20131980), Marion (1895\\u20131977), Richard (1897\\u20131974), and Francis (1903\\u20131995). British philosopher Philippa Foot was their granddaughter.William Grimes, \\\"Philippa Foot, Renowned Philosopher, Dies at 90\\\" NY Times October 9, 2010\\n\\nCleveland also claimed paternity of an additional child named Oscar Folsom Cleveland with Maria Croft Halpin.\\n\\nAdministration and Cabinet\\nthumb|right|upright=1.65|Cleveland's first Cabinet. Front row, left to right: Thomas F. Bayard, Cleveland, Daniel Manning, Lucius Q. C. Lamar  Back row, left to right: William F. Vilas, William C. Whitney, William C. Endicott, Augustus H. Garland \\n\\nJudicial appointments\\n\\nupright|thumb|upright=0.7|Chief Justice Melville Fuller\\nDuring his first term, Cleveland successfully nominated two justices to the Supreme Court of the United States. The first, Lucius Q. C. Lamar, was a former Mississippi Senator who served in Cleveland's Cabinet as Interior Secretary. When William Burnham Woods died, Cleveland nominated Lamar to his seat in late 1887. While Lamar had been well liked as a Senator, his service under the Confederacy two decades earlier caused many Republicans to vote against him. Lamar's nomination was confirmed by the narrow margin of 32 to 28.Daniel J. Meador, \\\"Lamar to the Court: Last Step to National Reunion\\\" Supreme Court Historical Society Yearbook 1986: 27\\u201347. \\n\\nChief Justice Morrison Waite died a few months later, and Cleveland nominated Melville Fuller to fill his seat on April 30, 1888. Fuller accepted. He had previously declined Cleveland's nomination to the Civil Service Commission, preferring his Chicago law practice. The Senate Judiciary Committee spent several months examining the little-known nominee, before the Senate confirmed the nomination 41 to 20.Willard L. King, Melville Weston Fuller \\u2013 Chief Justice of the United States 1888\\u20131910 (1950)Nevins, 445\\u2013450\\n\\nCleveland nominated 41 lower federal court judges in addition to his four Supreme Court justices. These included two judges to the United States circuit courts, nine judges to the United States Courts of Appeals, and 30 judges to the United States district courts. Because Cleveland served terms both before and after Congress eliminated the circuit courts in favor of the Courts of Appeals, he is one of only two presidents to have appointed judges to both bodies. The other, Benjamin Harrison, was in office at the time that the change was made. Thus, all of Cleveland's appointments to the circuit courts were made in his first term, and all of his appointments to the Courts of Appeals were made in his second.\\n\\nElection of 1888 and return to private life\\n\\nDefeated by Harrison\\n\\nthumb|right|Cleveland\\u2013Thurman campaign poster\\nthumb|right|upright=1.35|Results of the 1888 Election\\nThe Republicans nominated Benjamin Harrison of Indiana for president and Levi P. Morton of New York for vice president. Cleveland was easily renominated at the Democratic convention in St. Louis.Graff, 90\\u201391\\n\\nFollowing Vice President Thomas A. Hendricks death in 1885, the Democrats chose Allen G. Thurman of Ohio to be Cleveland's new running mate.\\n\\nThe Republicans gained the upper hand in the campaign, as Cleveland's campaign was poorly managed by Calvin S. Brice and William H. Barnum, whereas Harrison had engaged more aggressive fundraisers and tacticians in Matt Quay and John Wanamaker.Tugwell, 166\\n\\nThe Republicans campaigned heavily on the tariff issue, turning out protectionist voters in the important industrial states of the North.Nevins, 418\\u2013420 Further, the Democrats in New York were divided over the gubernatorial candidacy of David B. Hill, weakening Cleveland's support in that swing state.Nevins, 423\\u2013427 A letter from the British ambassador supporting Cleveland caused a scandal which cost Cleveland votes in New York.\\n\\nAs in 1884, the election focused on the swing states of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Indiana. But unlike that year, when Cleveland had triumphed in all four, in 1888 he won only two, losing his home state of New York by 14,373 votes.,  The Republicans won Indiana, largely as the result of a fraudulent voting practice known as Blocks of Five.Nevins, 435\\u2013439; Jeffers, 220\\u2013222 Cleveland continued his duties diligently until the end of the term and began to look forward to return to private life.Nevins, 443\\u2013449\\n\\nPrivate citizen for four years\\nAs Frances Cleveland left the White House, she told a staff member, \\\"Now, Jerry, I want you to take good care of all the furniture and ornaments in the house, for I want to find everything just as it is now, when we come back again.\\\" When asked when she would return, she responded, \\\"We are coming back four years from today.\\\"Nevins, 448 In the meantime, the Clevelands moved to New York City, where Cleveland took a position with the law firm of Bangs, Stetson, Tracy, and MacVeigh. This affiliation was more of an office-sharing arrangement, though quite compatible. Cleveland's law practice brought only a moderate income, perhaps because Cleveland spent considerable time at the couple's vacation home Gray Gables at Buzzard Bay, where fishing became his obsession.Tugwell, 175 While they lived in New York, the Clevelands' first child, Ruth, was born in 1891.Nevins, 450; Graff, 99\\u2013100\\n\\nThe Harrison administration worked with Congress to pass the McKinley Tariff, an aggressively protectionist measure, and the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, which increased money backed by silver;Tugwell, 168 these were among policies Cleveland deplored as dangerous to the nation's financial health.Graff, 102\\u2013105; Nevins, 465\\u2013467 At first he refrained from criticizing his successor, but by 1891 Cleveland felt compelled to speak out, addressing his concerns in an open letter to a meeting of reformers in New York.Graff, 104\\u2013105; Nevins, 467\\u2013468 The \\\"silver letter\\\" thrust Cleveland's name back into the spotlight just as the 1892 election was approaching.Nevins, 470\\u2013471\\n\\nElection of 1892\\n\\nDemocratic nomination\\nCleveland's enduring reputation as chief executive and his recent pronouncements on the monetary issues made him a leading contender for the Democratic nomination.Nevins, 468\\u2013469 His leading opponent was David B. Hill, a Senator for New York.Nevins, 470\\u2013473 Hill united the anti-Cleveland elements of the Democratic party\\u2014silverites, protectionists, and Tammany Hall\\u2014but was unable to create a coalition large enough to deny Cleveland the nomination. Despite some desperate maneuvering by Hill, Cleveland was nominated on the first ballot at the convention in Chicago.Tugwell, 182 For vice president, the Democrats chose to balance the ticket with Adlai E. Stevenson of Illinois, a silverite.Graff, 105; Nevins, 492\\u2013493 Although the Cleveland forces preferred Isaac P. Gray of Indiana for vice president, they accepted the convention favorite.William DeGregorio, The Complete Book of U.S. Presidents, Gramercy 1997 As a supporter of greenbacks and Free Silver to inflate the currency and alleviate economic distress in the rural districts, Stevenson balanced the otherwise hard-money, gold-standard ticket headed by Cleveland.\\n\\nCampaign against Harrison\\nthumb|upright=1.35|Results of the 1892 election\\nThe Republicans re-nominated President Harrison, making the 1892 election a rematch of the one four years earlier. Unlike the turbulent and controversial elections of 1876, 1884, and 1888, the 1892 election was, according to Cleveland biographer Allan Nevins, \\\"the cleanest, quietest, and most creditable in the memory of the post-war generation,\\\"Nevins, 498 in part because Harrison's wife, Caroline, was dying of tuberculosis.Calhoun, 149 Harrison did not personally campaign at all. Following Caroline Harrison's death on October 25, two weeks before the national election, Cleveland and all of the other candidates stopped campaigning, thus making Election Day a somber and quiet event for the whole country as well as the candidates.\\n\\nThe issue of the tariff had worked to the Republicans' advantage in 1888. The legislative revisions of the past four years also made imported goods so expensive that now many voters favored tariff reform and were skeptical of big business.Nevins, 499 Many Westerners, traditionally Republican voters, defected to James Weaver, the candidate of the new Populist Party. Weaver promised Free Silver, generous veterans' pensions, and an eight-hour work day.Graff, 106\\u2013107; Nevins, 505\\u2013506 The Tammany Hall Democrats adhered to the national ticket, allowing a united Democratic party to carry New York.Graff, 108 At the campaign's end, many Populists and labor supporters endorsed Cleveland after an attempt by the Carnegie Corporation to break the union during the Homestead strike in Pittsburgh and after a similar conflict between big business and labor at the Tennessee Coal and Iron Co.Tugwell, 184\\u2013185 The final result was a victory for Cleveland by wide margins in both the popular and electoral votes, and it was Cleveland's third consecutive popular vote plurality., \\n\\nSecond term as president (1893\\u20131897)\\n\\nEconomic panic and the silver issue\\nShortly after Cleveland's second term began, the Panic of 1893 struck the stock market, and he soon faced an acute economic depression.Graff, 114 The panic was worsened by the acute shortage of gold that resulted from the increased coinage of silver, and Cleveland called Congress into special session to deal with the problem.Nevins, 526\\u2013528 The debate over the coinage was as heated as ever, and the effects of the panic had driven more moderates to support repealing the coinage provisions of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act. Even so, the silverites rallied their following at a convention in Chicago, and the House of Representatives debated for fifteen weeks before passing the repeal by a considerable margin.Nevins, 524\\u2013528, 537\\u2013540. The vote was 239 to 108. In the Senate, the repeal of silver coinage was equally contentious. Cleveland, forced against his better judgment to lobby the Congress for repeal, convinced enough Democrats \\u2013 and along with eastern Republicans, they formed a 48\\u201337 majority for repeal.Tugwell, 192\\u2013195 Depletion of the Treasury's gold reserves continued, at a lesser rate, and subsequent bond issues replenished supplies of gold.Welch, 126\\u2013127 At the time the repeal seemed a minor setback to silverites, but it marked the beginning of the end of silver as a basis for American currency.\\n\\nTariff reform\\nthumb|Cleveland's humiliation by Gorman and the sugar trust\\n\\nHaving succeeded in reversing the Harrison administration's silver policy, Cleveland sought next to reverse the effects of the McKinley Tariff. The Wilson\\u2013Gorman Tariff Act was introduced by West Virginian Representative William L. Wilson in December 1893.Festus P. Summers, William L. Wilson and Tariff Reform: A Biography (1974) After lengthy debate, the bill passed the House by a considerable margin.Nevins, 567; the vote was 204 to 140 The bill proposed moderate downward revisions in the tariff, especially on raw materials.Nevins, 564\\u2013566; Jeffers, 285\\u2013287 The shortfall in revenue was to be made up by an income tax of two percent on income above $4,000 ().\\n\\nThe bill was next considered in the Senate, where it faced stronger opposition from key Democrats led by Arthur Pue Gorman of Maryland, who insisted on more protection for their states' industries than the Wilson bill allowed.Lambert, 213\\u201315 The bill passed the Senate with more than 600 amendments attached that nullified most of the reforms.The income tax component of the Wilson-Gorman Act was partially ruled unconstitutional in 1895. See Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. The Sugar Trust in particular lobbied for changes that favored it at the expense of the consumer.Nevins, 577\\u2013578 Cleveland was outraged with the final bill, and denounced it as a disgraceful product of the control of the Senate by trusts and business interests.Nevins, 585\\u2013587; Jeffers, 288\\u2013289 Even so, he believed it was an improvement over the McKinley tariff and allowed it to become law without his signature.Nevins, 564\\u2013588; Jeffers, 285\\u2013289\\n\\nVoting rights\\nIn 1892, Cleveland had campaigned against the Lodge Bill,James B. Hedges (1940), \\\"North America\\\", in William L. Langer, ed., An Encyclopedia of World History, Boston:  Houghton Mifflin, Part V, Section G, Subsection 1c, p. 794. which would have strengthened voting rights protections through the appointing of federal supervisors of congressional elections upon a petition from the citizens of any district. The Enforcement Act of 1871 had provided for a detailed federal overseeing of the electoral process, from registration to the certification of returns. Cleveland succeeded in ushering in the 1894 repeal of this law (ch. 25, 28 Stat. 36).Congressional Research Service (2004), The Constitution of the United States:  Analysis and Interpretation\\u2014Analysis of Cases Decided by the Supreme Court of the United States to June 28, 2002, Washington: Government Printing Office, \\\"Fifteenth Amendment\\\", \\\"Congressional Enforcement\\\", \\\"Federal Remedial Legislation\\\", p. 2058. The pendulum thus swung from stronger attempts to protect voting rights to the repealing of voting rights protections; this in turn led to unsuccessful attempts to have the federal courts protect voting rights in Giles v. Harris, 189 U.S. 475 (1903), and Giles v. Teasley, 193 U.S. 146 (1904).\\n\\nLabor unrest\\nthumb|left|upright|John T. Morgan, Senator from Alabama, opposed Cleveland on Free Silver, the tariff, and the Hawaii treaty, saying of Cleveland that \\\"I hate the ground that man walks on.\\\"Nevins, 568\\n\\nThe Panic of 1893 had damaged labor conditions across the United States, and the victory of anti-silver legislation worsened the mood of western laborers.Graff, 117\\u2013118; Nevins, 603\\u2013605 A group of workingmen led by Jacob S. Coxey began to march east toward Washington, D.C. to protest Cleveland's policies. This group, known as Coxey's Army, agitated in favor of a national roads program to give jobs to workingmen, and a weakened currency to help farmers pay their debts. By the time they reached Washington, only a few hundred remained, and when they were arrested the next day for walking on the lawn of the United States Capitol, the group scattered. Even though Coxey's Army may not have been a threat to the government, it signaled a growing dissatisfaction in the West with Eastern monetary policies.Graff, 118; Jeffers, 280\\u2013281\\n\\nPullman Strike\\n\\nThe Pullman Strike had a significantly greater impact than Coxey's Army. A strike began against the Pullman Company over low wages and twelve-hour workdays, and sympathy strikes, led by American Railway Union leader Eugene V. Debs, soon followed.Nevins, 611\\u2013613 By June 1894, 125,000 railroad workers were on strike, paralyzing the nation's commerce.Nevins, 614 Because the railroads carried the mail, and because several of the affected lines were in federal receivership, Cleveland believed a federal solution was appropriate.Nevins, 614\\u2013618; Graff, 118\\u2013119; Jeffers, 296\\u2013297 Cleveland obtained an injunction in federal court, and when the strikers refused to obey it, he sent federal troops into Chicago and 20 other rail centers.Nevins, 619\\u2013623; Jeffers, 298\\u2013302. See also In re Debs. \\\"If it takes the entire army and navy of the United States to deliver a postcard in Chicago\\\", he proclaimed, \\\"that card will be delivered.\\\"Nevins, 628 Most governors supported Cleveland except Democrat John P. Altgeld of Illinois, who became his bitter foe in 1896. Leading newspapers of both parties applauded Cleveland's actions, but the use of troops hardened the attitude of organized labor toward his administration.Nevins, 624\\u2013628; Jeffers, 304\\u2013305; Graff, 120\\n\\nJust before the 1894 election, Cleveland was warned by Francis Lynde Stetson, an advisor:\\n\\\"We are on the eve of [a] very dark night, unless a return of commercial prosperity relieves popular discontent with what they believe [is] Democratic incompetence to make laws, and consequently [discontent] with Democratic Administrations anywhere and everywhere.\\\"Francis Lynde Stetson to Cleveland, October 7, 1894 in Allan Nevins, ed. Letters of Grover Cleveland, 1850\\u20131908 (1933) p. 369\\n\\nThe warning was appropriate, for in the Congressional elections, Republicans won their biggest landslide in decades, taking full control of the House, while the Populists lost most of their support. Cleveland's factional enemies gained control of the Democratic Party in state after state, including full control in Illinois and Michigan, and made major gains in Ohio, Indiana, Iowa and other states. Wisconsin and Massachusetts were two of the few states that remained under the control of Cleveland's allies. The Democratic opposition were close to controlling two-thirds of the vote at the 1896 national convention, which they needed to nominate their own candidate. They failed for lack of unity and a national leader, as Illinois governor John Peter Altgeld had been born in Germany and was ineligible to be nominated for president.Richard J. Jensen, The Winning of the Midwest: Social and Political Conflict, 1888\\u201396 (1971) pp\\u00a0229\\u2013230\\n\\nForeign policy, 1893\\u20131897\\n\\n\\\"I suppose that right and justice should determine the path to be followed in treating this subject. If national honesty is to be disregarded and a desire for territorial expansion or dissatisfaction with a form of government not our own ought to regulate our conduct, I have entirely misapprehended the mission and character of our government and the behavior which the conscience of the people demands of their public servants.\\\" Cleveland's message to Congress on the Hawaiian question, December 18, 1893.Nevins, 560\\nthumb|upright=1.2|His Little Hawaiian Game Checkmated, 1894\\nWhen Cleveland took office he faced the question of Hawaiian annexation. In his first term, he had supported free trade with Hawai'i and accepted an amendment that gave the United States a coaling and naval station in Pearl Harbor. In the intervening four years, Honolulu businessmen of European and American ancestry had denounced Queen Liliuokalani as a tyrant who rejected constitutional government. In early 1893 they overthrew her, set up a republican government under Sanford B. Dole, and sought to join the United States.Nevins, 549\\u2013552; Graff 121\\u2013122 The Harrison administration had quickly agreed with representatives of the new government on a treaty of annexation and submitted it to the Senate for approval. Five days after taking office on March 9, 1893, Cleveland withdrew the treaty from the Senate and sent former Congressman James Henderson Blount to Hawai'i to investigate the conditions there.Nevins, 552\\u2013554; Graff, 122\\n\\nCleveland agreed with Blount's report, which found the populace to be opposed to annexation. Liliuokalani initially refused to grant amnesty as a condition of her reinstatement, saying that she would either execute or banish the current government in Honolulu, but Dole's government refused to yield their position.Nevins, 558\\u2013559 By December 1893, the matter was still unresolved, and Cleveland referred the issue to Congress. In his message to Congress, Cleveland rejected the idea of annexation and encouraged the Congress to continue the American tradition of non-intervention (see excerpt at right). The Senate, under Democratic control but opposed to Cleveland, commissioned and produced the Morgan Report, which contradicted Blount's findings and found the overthrow was a completely internal affair.Welch, 174 Cleveland dropped all talk of reinstating the Queen, and went on to recognize and maintain diplomatic relations with the new Republic of Hawaii.McWilliams, 25\\u201336\\n\\nCloser to home, Cleveland adopted a broad interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine that not only prohibited new European colonies, but also declared an American national interest in any matter of substance within the hemisphere.Zakaria, 145\\u2013146 When Britain and Venezuela disagreed over the boundary between Venezuela and the colony of British Guiana, Cleveland and Secretary of State Richard Olney protested.Graff, 123\\u2013125; Nevins, 633\\u2013642 British Prime Minister Lord Salisbury and the British ambassador to Washington, Julian Pauncefote, misjudged how important successful resolution of the dispute was to the American government, having prolonged the crisis before ultimately accepting the American demand for arbitration.Paul Gibb, \\\"Unmasterly Inactivity?

The battleships and seven of the torpedo boats were not completed until 1899\\u20131901, after the Spanish\\u2013American War.Bauer and Roberts, pp. 102\\u2013104, 162\\u2013165\\n\\nCancer\\nupright|left|thumb|Oil painting of Grover Cleveland, painted in 1899 by Anders Zorn\\nIn the midst of the fight for repeal of Free Silver coinage in 1893, Cleveland sought the advice of the White House doctor, Dr. O'Reilly, about soreness on the roof of his mouth and a crater-like edge ulcer with a granulated surface on the left side of Cleveland's hard palate. Samples of the tumor were sent anonymously to the Army Medical Museum. The diagnosis was not a malignant cancer, but instead an epithelioma.\\n\\nCleveland decided to have surgery secretly, to avoid further panic that might worsen the financial depression.Nevins, 528\\u2013529; Graff, 115\\u2013116 The surgery occurred on July 1, to give Cleveland time to make a full recovery in time for the upcoming Congressional session.Nevins, 531\\u2013533 Under the guise of a vacation cruise, Cleveland and his surgeon, Dr. Joseph Bryant, left for New York. The surgeons operated aboard the Oneida, a yacht owned by Cleveland's friend E. C. Benedict, as it sailed off Long Island.Nevins, 529 The surgery was conducted through the President's mouth, to avoid any scars or other signs of surgery.Nevins, 530\\u2013531 The team, sedating Cleveland with nitrous oxide and ether, successfully removed parts of his upper left jaw and hard palate. The size of the tumor and the extent of the operation left Cleveland's mouth disfigured.Nevins, 532\\u2013533 During another surgery, Cleveland was fitted with a hard rubber dental prosthesis that corrected his speech and restored his appearance. A cover story about the removal of two bad teeth kept the suspicious press placated.Nevins, 533; Graff, 116 Even when a newspaper story appeared giving details of the actual operation, the participating surgeons discounted the severity of what transpired during Cleveland's vacation. In 1917, one of the surgeons present on the Oneida, Dr. William W. Keen, wrote an article detailing the operation.\\n\\nCleveland enjoyed many years of life after the tumor was removed, and there was some debate as to whether it was actually malignant.  Several doctors, including Dr. Keen, stated after Cleveland's death that the tumor was a carcinoma. The lump was preserved and is on display at the M\\u00fctter Museum in Philadelphia\\nOther suggestions included ameloblastoma or a benign salivary mixed tumor (also known as a pleomorphic adenoma).\\nIn the 1980s, analysis of the specimen finally confirmed the tumor to be verrucous carcinoma, a low-grade epithelial cancer with a low potential for metastasis.\\n\\nAdministration and cabinet\\nthumb|right|upright=1.65|Cleveland's last Cabinet. Front row, left to right: Daniel S. Lamont, Richard Olney, Cleveland, John G. Carlisle, Judson Harmon  Back row, left to right: David R. Francis, William Lyne Wilson, Hilary A. Herbert, Julius S. Morton \\n\\nJudicial appointments\\n\\nCleveland's trouble with the Senate hindered the success of his nominations to the Supreme Court in his second term. In 1893, after the death of Samuel Blatchford, Cleveland nominated William B. Hornblower to the Court.Nevins, 569\\u2013570 Hornblower, the head of a New York City law firm, was thought to be a qualified appointee, but his campaign against a New York machine politician had made Senator David B. Hill his enemy. Further, Cleveland had not consulted the Senators before naming his appointee, leaving many who were already opposed to Cleveland on other grounds even more aggrieved. The Senate rejected Hornblower's nomination on January 15, 1894, by a vote of 30 to 24.\\n\\nCleveland continued to defy the Senate by next appointing Wheeler Hazard Peckham another New York attorney who had opposed Hill's machine in that state.Nevins, 570\\u2013571 Hill used all of his influence to block Peckham's confirmation, and on February 16, 1894, the Senate rejected the nomination by a vote of 32 to 41. Reformers urged Cleveland to continue the fight against Hill and to nominate Frederic R. Coudert, but Cleveland acquiesced in an inoffensive choice, that of Senator Edward Douglass White of Louisiana, whose nomination was accepted unanimously. Later, in 1896, another vacancy on the Court led Cleveland to consider Hornblower again, but he declined to be nominated.Nevins, 572 Instead, Cleveland nominated Rufus Wheeler Peckham, the brother of Wheeler Hazard Peckham, and the Senate confirmed the second Peckham easily.\\n\\nStates admitted to the Union\\nNo new states were admitted to the Union during Cleveland's first term. On February 22, 1889,  days before leaving office, the 50th Congress passed the Enabling Act of 1889, authorizing North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, and Washington to form state governments and to gain admission to the Union. All four officially became states in November 1889, during the first year of Benjamin Harrison's administration. During his second term, the 53rd United States Congress passed an Enabling Act that permitted Utah to apply for statehood. Cleveland signed it on July 16, 1894. Utah joined the Union as the 45th state on January 4, 1896.\\n\\n1896 election and retirement\\nthumb|upright|left|Cleveland in 1903 at age 66 by Frederick Gutekunst\\nCleveland's agrarian and silverite enemies gained control of the Democratic party in 1896, repudiated his administration and the gold standard, and nominated William Jennings Bryan on a Silver Platform.Nevins, 684\\u2013693R. Hal Williams, Years of Decision: American Politics in the 1890s (1993) Cleveland silently supported the Gold Democrats' third-party ticket that promised to defend the gold standard, limit government and oppose high tariffs, but he declined their nomination for a third term.Graff, 128\\u2013129 The party won only 100,000 votes in the general election, and William McKinley, the Republican nominee, triumphed easily over Bryan. Agrarians nominated Bryan again in 1900. In 1904 the conservatives, with Cleveland's support, regained control of the Democratic Party and nominated Alton B. Parker.Nevins, 754\\u2013758\\n\\nthumb|right|Outgoing President Grover Cleveland, at right, stands nearby as William McKinley is sworn in as president by Chief Justice Melville Fuller.\\nAfter leaving the White House on March 4, 1897, Cleveland lived in retirement at his estate, Westland Mansion, in Princeton, New Jersey.Graff, 131\\u2013133; Nevins, 730\\u2013735 For a time he was a trustee of Princeton University, and was one of the majority of trustees who preferred Dean West's plans for the Graduate School and undergraduate living over those of Woodrow Wilson, then president of the university.Graff, p. 131; Alexander Leitch, A Princeton Companion, Princeton Univ Press, 1978, \\\"Grover Cleveland\\\" Cleveland consulted occasionally with President Theodore Roosevelt (1901\\u20131909), but was financially unable to accept the chairmanship of the commission handling the Coal Strike of 1902.Nevins, 748\\u2013751 Cleveland still made his views known in political matters. In a 1905 article in The Ladies Home Journal, Cleveland weighed in on the women's suffrage movement, writing that \\\"sensible and responsible women do not want to vote. The relative positions to be assumed by men and women in the working out of our civilization were assigned long ago by a higher intelligence.\\\"Ladies Home Journal 22, (October 1905), 7\\u20138\\n\\nIn 1906, a group of New Jersey Democrats promoted Cleveland as a possible candidate for the United States Senate.  The incumbent, John F. Dryden, was not seeking re-election, and some Democrats felt that the former president could attract the votes of some disaffected Republican legislators who might be drawn to Cleveland's statesmanship and conservatism.\\n\\nCleveland's health had been declining for several years, and in the autumn of 1907 he fell seriously ill.Graff, 135\\u2013136; Nevins, 762\\u2013764 In 1908, he suffered a heart attack and died on June 24 at age 71. His last words were, \\\"I have tried so hard to do right.\\\"Jeffers, 340; Graff, 135. Nevins makes no mention of these last words. He is buried in the Princeton Cemetery of the Nassau Presbyterian Church.\\n\\nHonors and memorials\\n\\nIn his first term in office, Cleveland sought a summer house to escape the heat and smells of Washington, D.C., near enough the capital. He secretly bought a farmhouse, Oak View (or Oak Hill), in a rural upland part of the District of Columbia, in 1886, and remodeled it into a Queen Anne style summer estate. He sold Oak View upon losing his bid for re-election in 1888.  Not long thereafter, suburban residential development reached the area, which came to be known as Oak View, and then Cleveland Heights, and eventually Cleveland Park.Kimberly Prothro Williams, Cleveland Park Historic District brochure, D.C. Preservation League, 2001. The Clevelands are depicted in local murals.See, e.g.\\n\\nGrover Cleveland Hall at Buffalo State College in Buffalo, New York. Cleveland Hall houses the offices of the college president, vice presidents, and other administrative functions and student services. Cleveland was a member of the first board of directors of the then Buffalo Normal School. Grover Cleveland Middle School in his birthplace, Caldwell, New Jersey, was named for him, as is Grover Cleveland High School in Buffalo, New York, and the town of Cleveland, Mississippi. Mount Cleveland, a volcano in Alaska, is also named after him. In 1895 he became the first U.S. President who was filmed.\\n\\nThe first U.S. postage stamp to honor Cleveland appeared in 1923.  This twelve-cent issue accompanied a thirteen-cent stamp in the same definitive series that depicted his old rival Benjamin Harrison.  Cleveland's only two subsequent stamp appearances have been in issues devoted to the full roster of U.S. Presidents, released, respectively, in 1938 and 1986.\\n\\nCleveland's portrait was on the U.S. $1000 bill of series 1928 and series 1934. He also appeared on the first few issues of the $20 Federal Reserve Notes from 1914. Since he was both the 22nd and 24th president, he was featured on two separate dollar coins released in 2012 as part of the Presidential $1 Coin Act of 2005.\\n\\nIn 2013, Cleveland was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame.\\n\\nSee also\\n Grover Cleveland Birthplace\\n Presidencies of Grover Cleveland\\n Child with Maria Halpin\\n Children with Frances Cleveland\\n\\nNotes\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nFurther reading\\n\\nScholarly studies\\n \\n Bard, Mitchell. \\\"Ideology and Depression Politics I: Grover Cleveland (1893\\u20131897)\\\" Presidential Studies Quarterly 1985 15(1): 77\\u201388. \\n Beito, David T. and Beito, Linda Royster,\\\"Gold Democrats and the Decline of Classical Liberalism, 1896\\u20131900,\\\" Independent Review 4 (Spring 2000), 555\\u2013575.\\n \\n Blake, Nelson M. \\\"Background of Cleveland's Venezuelan Policy.\\\" American Historical Review 1942 47(2): 259\\u2013277. in Jstor\\n Blodgett, Geoffrey. \\\"Ethno-cultural Realities in Presidential Patronage: Grover Cleveland's Choices\\\" New York History 2000 81(2): 189\\u2013210.  when a German American leader called for fewer appointments of Irish Americans, Cleveland instead appointed more Germans\\n Blodgett, Geoffrey. \\\"The Emergence of Grover Cleveland: a Fresh Appraisal\\\" New York History 1992 73(2): 132\\u2013168.  covers Cleveland to 1884\\n Blum, John.
