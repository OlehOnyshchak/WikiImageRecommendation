"{\"title\": \"Wilco\", \"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilco\", \"text\": \"Wilco is an American alternative rock band based in Chicago, Illinois. The band was formed in 1994 by the remaining members of alternative country group Uncle Tupelo following singer Jay Farrar's departure. Wilco's lineup changed frequently during its first decade, with only singer Jeff Tweedy and bassist John Stirratt remaining from the original incarnation. Since early 2004, the lineup has been unchanged, consisting of Tweedy, Stirratt, guitarist Nels Cline, multi-instrumentalist Pat Sansone, keyboard player Mikael Jorgensen, and drummer Glenn Kotche. Wilco has released ten studio albums, a live double album, and four collaborations: three with Billy Bragg and one with The Minus 5.\\n\\nWilco's music has been inspired by a wide variety of artists and styles, including Bill Fay, The Beatles and Television, and has in turn influenced music by a number of modern alternative rock acts. The band continued in the alternative country style of Uncle Tupelo on its debut album A.M. (1995), but has since introduced more experimental aspects to their music, including elements of alternative rock and classic pop. Wilco's musical style has evolved from a 1990s country rock sound to a current \\\"eclectic indie rock collective that touches on many eras and genres.\\\"\\n\\nWilco garnered media attention for their fourth album, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot (2001), and the controversy surrounding it. After the recording sessions were complete, Reprise Records rejected the album and dismissed Wilco from the label. As part of a buy-out deal, Reprise gave Wilco the rights to the album for free. After streaming Foxtrot on its website, Wilco sold the album to Nonesuch Records in 2002. Both record labels are subsidiaries of Warner Music Group, leading one critic to say the album showed \\\"how screwed up the music business is in the early twenty-first century.\\\" Last accessed July 18, 2007. Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is Wilco's most successful release to date, selling over 670,000 copies. Wilco won two Grammy Awards for their fifth studio album, 2004's A Ghost Is Born, including Best Alternative Music Album. Wilco released their ninth studio album, Star Wars, in July 2015, and in September 2016 released their tenth studio album, Schmilco, followed finally by their eleventh studio album, Ode to Joy, in October 2019.\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nFormation\\n\\nWilco was formed following the breakup of the influential alternative country music group Uncle Tupelo. Singer Jay Farrar quit the band in 1994 because of a soured relationship with co-singer Jeff Tweedy. Last accessed July 9, 2007. Both Tweedy and Farrar sought to form bands immediately after the breakup. Tweedy was able to keep the entire Uncle Tupelo lineup sans Farrar, including bassist John Stirratt, drummer Ken Coomer, and multi-instrumentalist Max Johnston. He even enlisted Uncle Tupelo guest guitarist Brian Henneman of the Bottle Rockets, who performed on many of the tracks for Wilco's debut album, A.M..Undertownmusic.com  The band was tempted to keep the Uncle Tupelo name, but ultimately decided to rename the band. The group named itself \\\"Wilco\\\" after the military and commercial aviation radio voice abbreviation for \\\"will comply\\\",Kot 2004. p. 89 a choice which Tweedy has called \\\"fairly ironic for a rock band to name themselves.\\\"Cynthia Bowers (August 23, 2009). \\\"A Summer Song\\\", CBS News Sunday Morning\\n\\nA.M. and Being There\\nAfter collaborating with Syd Straw on a cover version of the Ernest Tubb song \\\"The T.B. is Whipping Me\\\" (released in September 1994 on the Red Hot + Country compilation produced by the Red Hot Organization), Wilco began recording tracks for A.M., their first studio album, at Easley studio in June 1994. A demo tape from these recordings was sent to executives at Reprise Records, a subsidiary of Warner Brothers, and the label signed Tweedy to a contract. Although Tweedy stated that he wanted a more collaborative project than Uncle Tupelo, only his name appeared on the Reprise contract.Kot 2004. p. 92 Tweedy requested songwriting submissions from other members, but only one submission\\u2014John Stirratt's \\\"It's Just That Simple\\\"\\u2014appeared on A.M.. It was the last song Wilco ever released that was lyrically solely written by a member besides Tweedy.\\n\\nStylistically similar to Uncle Tupelo, the music on A.M. was considered to be straightforward alternative country rock in what Tweedy later described as \\\"trying to tread some water with a perceived audience.\\\" A.M. peaked at number twenty-seven on the Billboard Heatseekers chart, considerably lower than the debut album of Jay Farrar's new band, Son Volt. The album was met with modest reviews though it would rank thirty-fourth in the Village Voice'''s 1995 Pazz & Jop critics poll. Last accessed July 9, 2007. Last accessed July 9, 2007. Last accessed July 11, 2007. Critically and commercially paling in comparison to the reception of Son Volt's album, the Wilco members perceived A.M. to be a failure.Kot 2004. p. 97 Shortly after the release of the album, multi-instrumentalist Jay Bennett joined the band, providing the band with a keyboardist and another guitarist.\\n\\nWilco made its live debut on November 17, 1994 to a capacity crowd at Cicero's Basement Bar in St. Louis, Missouri (the band was billed for the occasion as \\\"Black Shampoo\\\"). Last accessed September 2, 2007.\\n\\nDuring the two hundred-date tour supporting A.M., Tweedy began to write songs for a second album. The lyrical theme of the songs reflected a relationship between musical artist and a listener; Tweedy chose this topic because he sought to eschew the alternative country fan base. Ken Coomer elaborated:Kot 2004. p. 110\\u20131\\n\\nThe whole No Depression thing was funny to us because people seemed to forget that Jeff was a bigger punk-rock fan than a country fan. It led to things like us all switching instruments on \\\"Misunderstood,\\\" where I'm playing guitar.\\n\\nA number of songs were recorded with this theme, including \\\"Sunken Treasure\\\" and \\\"Hotel Arizona\\\",Kot 2004. p. 112 however, Wilco also recorded a number of songs in the style of A.M. Last accessed July 11, 2007. Wilco named the album Being There after a Peter Sellers film of the same name. The band went through some personnel changes during the recording sessions. Max Johnston left the band because he felt that his role in the band had diminished in favor of Bennett; he had also been replaced by violinist Jesse Greene on one track because the band felt that Johnston was unable to play the part. Bob Egan of Freakwater briefly joined the band in the studio, playing pedal steel guitar on \\\"Far, Far Away\\\" and \\\"Dreamer in My Dreams\\\", and then became an official member in September 1996.Kot 2004. p. 115Kot 2004. p. 119\\n\\nUnlike the A.M. recording sessions, the band had no vocation for producing a hit song from their second effort.Kot 2004. p. 114 The recording sessions produced nineteen songs, too many for a single album release. Tweedy was concerned about the high retail price that a double album would be sold for (at least $30), so he asked Reprise Records to release it as a double album at a single album price ($17.98 or less). Reprise agreed to this on the terms that they received Wilco's share of the album royalties. It was estimated in 2003 that the band lost almost $600,000 on the deal, but Tweedy was satisfied.Kot 2004. p. 116 Being There was well received by critics from several major media outlets, including Rolling Stone. Last accessed July 11, 2007. Last accessed July 11, 2007. The album reached No. 73 on the Billboard album charts, a significant improvement from A.M., and placed fourteenth on the Pazz & Jop Critics Poll for 1996. Last accessed July 11, 2007. The album's single \\\"Outtasite (Outta Mind)\\\" became the group's first song to enter the Billboard charts, reaching No. 39 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart and No. 22 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart.\\n\\nSummerteeth and the Mermaid Avenue sessions\\nIn November 1997, Wilco entered Willie Nelson's recording studio in Spicewood, Texas to record a third studio album.Kot 2004. p. 138 The album was lyrically inspired by the marital problems of Tweedy and his wife, as well as by twentieth-century literature.Kot 2004. p. 135 Tweedy relied heavily on Bennett to provide music for the singer's \\\"bold, but depressing\\\" lyrics.Kot 2004. p. 140\\u20131 Wilco recorded several songs, including \\\"Via Chicago\\\" and \\\"She's a Jar\\\", but began working on another project before assembling the tracks into an album.\\nleft|thumb|The two Mermaid Avenue albums consisted of recordings of unreleased Woody Guthrie (pictured) songs.\\nNora Guthrie contacted singer-songwriter Billy Bragg in spring 1995 about recording some unreleased songs by her father, folk singer Woody Guthrie. Most of the songs were written late in Guthrie's life when he was unable to record due to the motor impairments of Huntington's disease. By the 1990s, Woody Guthrie had become a \\\"relic\\\" to the MTV generation, and Nora sought to establish a different legacy for the musician. To Nora, Bragg was \\\"the only singer I knew taking on the same issues as Woody.\\\" Bragg was concerned, however, that his fans would not realize that the songs were written by Guthrie when he performed them on tour, so he decided to record the album with another band.Kot 2004. p. 143\\n\\nBragg contacted Tweedy and Bennett about co-recording the album while Wilco was on the European segment of their Being There tour. Bragg was particularly fond of Being There because their influences extended farther back than the 1950s. Although Tweedy was indifferent to the offer, Bennett was enthused about recording songs of one of his idols\\u2014Bennett's previous band Titanic Love Affair was named after a Billy Bragg lyric. A recording contract between Bragg and Wilco was signed after a show at Shepherd's Bush Empire. Bragg mostly recorded the politically charged lyrics, while Tweedy preferred to record lyrics that showcased Guthrie as a \\\"freak weirdo\\\". The recording of Mermaid Avenue began on December 12, 1997, and was the topic of BBC's Man in the Sand documentary film.Kot 2004. p. 144\\u20135\\n\\nTempers flared between Bragg and Wilco after the album was completed. Bennett believed that Bragg was overproducing his songs, a sharp contrast to Wilco's sparser contributions. Bennett called Bragg about the possibility of remixing Bragg's songs, to which Bragg responded \\\"you make your record, and I'll make mine, fucker.\\\" Eventually Bragg sent copies of his recordings to Chicago for Bennett to remix, but Bragg refused to use the new mixes on the album. The two parties were unable to establish a promotional tour and quarreled over royalties and guest musician fees.\\n\\nDespite these conflicts, the album was released on June 23, 1998, and sold over 277,000 copies.Kot 2004. p. 151\\u20133 The album received rave reviews from Robert Christgau and Rolling Stone, and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album. Last accessed July 14, 2007. Last accessed July 14, 2007. It also placed fourth on the Pazz & Jop critics poll for 1998. Last accessed July 14, 2007. After the album was released, Bob Egan was replaced by multi-instrumentalist Leroy Bach.Kot 2004. p. 169\\n\\nAfter the completion of the Mermaid Avenue sessions, Wilco returned to Spicewood to complete their third studio album, Summerteeth. Unlike previous Wilco and Uncle Tupelo recordings, the album featured a lot of overdubbing with Pro Tools.Kot 2004. p. 154\\u20135 Stirratt and Coomer were concerned with the production, since it reduced their involvement in the music. According to Stirratt:Kot 2004. p. 158\\n\\nThe story of Summerteeth is Jay bought a Mellotron and he was going to use it, no matter what. It was lovely, but it was overdone. Once they got going on the overdubs, they didn't stop. And nobody in the band stepped up to stop the madness\\u00a0... It reminds me of Heart of Darkness, where you knowingly extend the creative process for the purpose of exploration or redemption, or whatever it is you're looking for.\\n\\nDuring 1999, Warner Brothers was looking to help repay a $16 billion debt acquired during the recent merger of parent company Warner Communications with Time Inc..Kot 2004. p. 161 As a result, Warner's imprints were under pressure to produce musical acts that would yield hit records. The head of Reprise, Howie Klein, who had previously authorized the release of Being There as a double album, was willing to let Wilco produce Summerteeth without label input. When Klein played the album for Reprise's A&R department, however, they demanded a radio single for the album. Wilco agreed to do this \\\"once and once only\\\" and recorded a radio-friendly version of \\\"Can't Stand It\\\" at the request of David Kahne, the head of the A&R department.Kot 2004. p. 162\\u20135 The single version of \\\"Can't Stand It\\\" failed to cross over from Triple-A radio to alternative rock stations. Consequently, the album sold only 200,000 copies, significantly less than Being There.Kot 2004. p. 167 This was despite critical acclaim; the album placed eighth on the Pazz & Jop critics' poll for 1999. Last accessed July 15, 2007.\\n\\nAfter the release of Summerteeth, the band resumed the Mermaid Avenue sessions. Although they had recorded enough material for a second release in 1998, Wilco recorded a few new songs for Mermaid Avenue Vol. II. \\\"Someday Some Morning Sometime,\\\" featuring a vibraphone filtered through a space echo, was identified by Tweedy as being the \\\"piece to the puzzle\\\" towards the creation of their fourth studio album. The album was released on May 30, 2000, and was the last release from the sessions.Kot 2004. p. 175 The remainder of the sessions were released in 2012 as Mermaid Avenue Vol. III, also part of Mermaid Avenue: The Complete Sessions.\\n\\nYankee Hotel Foxtrot\\n[[File:Marina City, Chicago, Illinois, Estados Unidos, 2012-10-20, DD 01.jpg|thumb|right|The Marina Towers in Chicago, IL are depicted on the cover of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.]]\\n\\nShortly after the recording sessions for Mermaid Avenue Vol. II, Wilco purchased a studio on Irving Park Road in Chicago, which they named the Wilco Loft.Kot 2004. p. 168 The band recorded some tracks in the studio in early 2000 for a fourth studio album. In May 2000, Jeff Tweedy requested to perform with Jim O'Rourke at a festival in Chicago; Tweedy was a fan of O'Rourke's Bad Timing. O'Rourke introduced Tweedy to drummer Glenn Kotche, and the trio enjoyed working together so much that they decided to record an album as a side project named Loose Fur.Kot 2004. p. 177\\u20139 Wilco had recorded an entire album of music at this point, but Tweedy was unhappy with the drum parts. He enjoyed Kotche's contributions to Loose Fur so much that Tweedy brought him into the studio to re-record some demos. Some believe that Tweedy sought to make Wilco sound like Loose Fur after officially replacing Ken Coomer with Kotche in January 2001.Kot 2004. p. 186\\u20138\\n\\nAlthough Bennett sought to act as both mixer and engineer for Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, Tweedy was unsure of Bennett's abilities against those of O'Rourke. Tweedy and Bennett frequently argued over whether the album should be accessible to a general listener, or attempt to cover new musical ground.Kot 2004. p. 195\\u20136 Unbeknownst to Bennett, Tweedy invited O'Rourke to remix \\\"I Am Trying to Break Your Heart\\\", and the results impressed the other band members\\u2014even Bennett. Tensions grew between Bennett and O'Rourke because Bennett wanted to mix every song on the album. O'Rourke cut the contributions of other members on several of the songs; some songs, such as \\\"Poor Places\\\", only featured the Loose Fur trio.Kot 2004. p. 198\\u20139 The album was completed in 2001, and Bennett was dismissed from the band immediately afterwards. The recording of the album was documented by Sam Jones and released in 2002 as the film I Am Trying to Break Your Heart: A Film About Wilco.\\n\\nTime Warner, which owned Warner Bros. Records, merged with America Online in 2001, leading to more pressure on Warner's record labels to cut costs. Over 600 employees of Warner Music Group were fired, including Howie Klein, the president of Reprise Records. In absence of Klein, David Kahne became the interim head of Reprise.Kot 2004. p. 201 Kahne assigned Mio Vukovic to monitor the progress of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot and to offer suggestions. Music journalist Greg Kot claims that Vukovic disdained the album and was unhappy that Wilco ignored his suggestions.Kot 2004. p. 202 He brought the album to Kahne, who felt that there was no single on the album. In June 2001, the album was rejected by Reprise and Wilco was asked to leave the label.Kot 2004. p. 203\\n\\nWilco managed to negotiate terms to a buy-out from Reprise. Music journalist Greg Kot claims that instead of financial compensation, the band agreed to leave the label with the master tapes of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.Kot 2004, p. 207 The label was already receiving bad publicity for its treatment of the band and were willing to accommodate Wilco's request.

Lead singer Wayne Coyne once remarked:Kot 2004. p. 209\\n\\nWe are benefiting from the label's regret over Wilco. We are living in the golden age of that being such a public mistake. The people on Warners said, \\\"we'll never have a band like Wilco feel we don't believe in them again.\\\" They'd tell me that it would never happen to us.
