"{\"title\": \"Emperor Norton\", \"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Norton\", \"text\": \"Joshua Abraham Norton  (February 4, 1818There are a number of different claims regarding Norton's date of birth. Norton's obituary by the San Francisco Chronicle put him at 65 at the time of his death, which would suggest that he was born in 1814. But William Drury notes in his 1986 biography Norton I: Emperor of the United States that the Chronicle's report was a reference to the inscription mounted on Norton's casket and was based on a guess by his landlady. Many sources follow Robert Ernest Cowan's 1923 account and Norton's 1934 tombstone in pinpointing his birth to sometime in 1819; Cowan specified February 4, 1819. But Allen Stanley Lane in his 1939 biography Emperor Norton: The Mad Monarch of America and Drury both settle on 1818. Drury cites South African immigration records in which Norton's father John said that Norton was two years old when the family arrived in South Africa on May 2, 1820. These records would put Norton's birth somewhere between mid-1817 and early 1818. In December 2014, The Emperor's Bridge Campaign reported on the rediscovery of an item in the February 4, 1865, issue of The Daily Alta California which points to a birth date of February 4, 1818. The Campaign also showed that Cowan doctored the original text of the Alta item in his 1923 account to back his claim of February 4, 1819.\\u00a0\\u2013 January 8, 1880), known as Emperor Norton, was a citizen of San Francisco, California, who proclaimed himself \\\"Norton I, Emperor of the United States\\\" in 1859. In 1863 he took the secondary title of \\\"Protector of Mexico\\\" after Napoleon III invaded the country. Norton was born in England but spent most of his early life in South Africa. He sailed west after the death of his mother in 1846 and his father in 1848, arriving in San Francisco possibly in November 1849.John Lumea, \\\"How and When Did Joshua Norton Get to San Francisco?, The Emperor's Bridge Campaign, February 10, 2017.\\n\\nNorton initially made a living as a businessman, but he lost his fortune investing in Peruvian rice to sell in China due to a Chinese rice shortage. He bought rice at 12 cents per pound from Peruvian ships, but more Peruvian ships arrived in port which caused the price to drop sharply to 4 cents. He then lost a lawsuit in which he tried to void his rice contract, and his public prominence faded. He re-emerged in September 1859, laying claim to the position of Emperor of the United States. Though Norton received many favors from the city, merchants also capitalized on his notoriety by selling souvenirs bearing his name. \\u201cSan Francisco lived off the Emperor Norton,\\u201d Norton's biographer William Drury wrote, \\u201cnot Norton off San Francisco.\\u201d\\n\\nNorton had no formal political power; nevertheless, he was treated deferentially in San Francisco, and currency issued in his name was honored in the establishments that he frequented. Some considered him insane or eccentric, but citizens of San Francisco celebrated his imperial presence and his proclamations, such as his order that the United States Congress be dissolved by force and his numerous decrees calling for the construction of a bridge and tunnel crossing San Francisco Bay to connect San Francisco with Oakland.\\n\\nOn January 8, 1880, Norton collapsed at the corner of California and Dupont (now Grant) streets and died before he could be given medical treatment. Upwards of 10,000 people lined the streets of San Francisco to pay him homage at his funeral. Norton has been immortalized as the basis of characters in the literature of Mark Twain, Robert Louis Stevenson, Christopher Moore, Morris and Ren\\u00e9 Goscinny, Selma Lagerl\\u00f6f, and Neil Gaiman.\\n\\nBiography\\nEarly life\\nNorton's parents were John Norton (d. August 1848) and Sarah Norden, who were English Jews. John was a farmer and merchant, and Sarah was a daughter of Abraham Norden and a sister of Benjamin Norden, a successful merchant. The family moved to South Africa in early 1820 as part of a government-backed colonization scheme whose participants came to be known as the 1820 Settlers.\\\"Joshua Abraham Norton\\\" at 1820Settlers.com.William Drury, Norton I: Emperor of the United States (Dodd, Mead & Co., 1986), pp.10\\u201315. Most likely, Norton was born in the Kentish town of Deptford, today part of London.William Drury, Norton I: Emperor of the United States (Dodd, Mead & Co., 1986), p.14.\\n\\nThe best available evidence points to February 4, 1818, as the date of Norton's birth. Obituaries published in 1880, following Norton's death, offered conflicting information about his birth date. The second of two obituaries in the San Francisco Chronicle \\u2013 \\\"following the best information obtainable\\\" \\u2013 cited the silver plate on his coffin which said he was \\\"aged about 65,\\\" suggesting that 1814 could be the year of his birth. However, Norton's biographer, William Drury, points out that \\\"about 65\\\" was based solely on the guess that Norton's landlady offered to the coroner at the inquest following his death.William Drury, Norton I: Emperor of the United States (Dodd, Mead & Co., 1986), p.10. \\\"The age on the coffin lid, however, was merely a guess. At the inquest, Eva Hutchinson, the landlady of Eureka Lodgings, the cheap hotel that was the Emperor's home for seventeen years, had testified that to the best of her belief he was 'a Jew of London birth.' And his age? Oh, about sixty-five. The coroner, lacking a birth certificate or any other material evidence, had simply accepted her word. And so the plate on his casket had been inscribed:  JOSHUA A. NORTON DIED JANUARY 8, 1880 AGED 65 YEARS.\\\" In a 1923 essay published by the California Historical Society, Robert Ernest Cowan claimed that Norton was born on February 4, 1819. However, the passenger lists for the La Belle Alliance, the ship that carried Norton and his family from England to South Africa, list him as having been two years old when the ship set sail in February 1820.\\\"1820 Settler Party: Willson\\\" at 1820Settlers.com. This page contains information about the passage of the ship La Belle Alliance that carried young Joshua and his family from London to South Africa from February to May 1820, including the London passenger list showing Joshua to have been 2 years old at the time of his boarding. This information appears not to have come to light until after 1934, the year that Norton's headstone was placed at his grave in Colma, California \\u2014 when Cowan's account remained prominent. This may help to explain why those who had the stone made used 1819 as the birth year.\\n\\nThe February 4, 1865, edition of The Daily Alta California newspaper included an item in which the Alta wished Emperor Norton a happy 47th birthday, indicating that his birth date was February 4, 1818 (not 1819, as Cowan claimed) \\u2014 a date that would line up with La Belle Alliances  passenger list from two years later.John Lumea, \\\"Homing in on the Birth Date?\\\" December 2, 2014. Reports on an item in the February 4, 1865, edition of The Daily Alta California, in which the Alta wrote: \\\"HIS MAJESTY'S BIRTHDAY.\\u2014His Imperial Majesty Norton I, Emperor of the United States and Mexico, commences his forty-eighth year Saturday, February 4th, 1865.\\\"\\\"Norton, Joshua Abraham \\u2013 newspaper cutting\\\" at 1820Settlers.com.John Lumea, \\\"Joshua Abraham Norton, b. 4 February 1818,\\\" The Emperor's Bridge Campaign, February 8, 2015. Moreover, when Cowan quoted the 1865 Alta item in his essay, he used an altered version in an apparent attempt to advance his claim of an 1819 birth date. Persistent claims for an 1819 birth date are of doubtful provenance, tracing to unsubstantiated assertions made online, during the early years of the Internet.John Lumea, \\\"Zpub, Emperor Norton Records & the Emperor's Birth Date: A Case Study in Good Intentions & Undue Influence,\\\" The Emperor's Bridge Campaign, February 16, 2015. The Emperor's Bridge Campaign, a San Francisco-based nonprofit that engages in Norton research and education, produced a 2018 bicentennial series, Emperor Norton at 200, that took as its starting point a February 4, 1818, birth date for Norton. Supporting and participating in the series were a number of institutions that long have helped to preserve the historical record of Emperor Norton: the California Historical Society, the San Francisco Public Library, the Mechanics' Institute and the Society of California Pioneers.The Emperor's Bridge Campaign, Emperor Norton at 200.\\n\\nThere are oft-repeated historical claims that Joshua Norton arrived in San Francisco on a specific vessel, the Franzeska, on November 23, 1849; that he arrived with $40,000, in whole or in part a bequest from his father's estate; and that he parlayed this into a fortune of $250,000. None of this is substantiated by contemporaneous documentation.John Lumea, \\\"How and When Did Joshua Norton Get to San Francisco?, The Emperor's Bridge Campaign, February 10, 2017.John Lumea, \\\"Did Joshua Norton Really Arrive in San Francisco With a $40,000 Inheritance That He Built Into a Quarter-Million-Dollar Fortune in 3 Years?\\\", The Emperor's Bridge Campaign, April 12, 2017. What is known is that, after Norton arrived in San Francisco, he enjoyed a good deal of success in commodities markets and in real estate speculation, and that by late 1852, he was one of the more prosperous, respected citizens of the city.\\n\\nIn December 1852, Norton thought he saw a business opportunity when China, facing a severe famine, placed a ban on the export of rice, causing the price of rice in San Francisco to skyrocket from four to thirty-six cents per pound (9 to 79 cents/kg). When he heard the Glyde, which was returning from Peru, was carrying  of rice, he bought the entire shipment for $25,000 (or twelve and a half cents per pound), hoping to corner the market.\\nShortly after he signed the contract, several other shiploads of rice arrived from Peru, causing the price of rice to plummet to three cents a pound. Norton tried to void the contract, stating the dealer had misled him as to the quality of rice to expect. From 1853 to 1856, Norton and the rice dealers were involved in a protracted litigation. Although Norton prevailed in the lower courts, the case reached the Supreme Court of California, which ruled against Norton.Ruiz v. Norton, 4 Cal. 355 (1854). Later, the Lucas Turner and Company Bank foreclosed on his real estate holdings in North Beach to pay Norton's debt. He filed for bankruptcy and by 1858 was living in reduced circumstances at a working class boarding house.\\n\\nDeclaration as emperor\\nthumb|alt=Emperor Norton in full dress uniform and military regalia, his hand on the hilt of a ceremonial sabre.|Emperor Norton in full dress uniform and military regalia, his hand on the hilt of a ceremonial sabre,  1875.\\nBy 1859, Norton had become completely discontented with what he considered the inadequacies of the legal and political structures of the United States. On September 17, 1859, he took matters into his own hands and distributed letters to the various newspapers in the city, proclaiming himself \\\"Emperor of these United States\\\":\\n\\nThe announcement was first printed for humorous effect by the editor of the San Francisco Daily Evening Bulletin. Norton later added \\\"Protector of Mexico\\\" to this title, and thus began his whimsical 21-year \\\"reign\\\" over America.\\nthumb|alt=An undated proclamation issued by Emperor Norton I regarding the assumption of his prerogatives by \\\"certain parties\\\" on display at the Wells Fargo History Museum in San Francisco, California.|One of Norton's undated proclamations\\n\\nNorton issued numerous decrees on matters of the state, including a decree on October 12, 1859 to formally abolish the United States Congress. In it, he observed:\\n\\nNorton ordered all interested parties to assemble at Platt's Music Hall in San Francisco in February 1860 to \\\"remedy the evil complained of\\\".\\n\\nIn an imperial decree the following month, Norton summoned the Army to depose the elected officials of the U.S. Congress:\\n\\nNorton's orders were ignored by the Army, and Congress likewise continued without any formal acknowledgement of the decree. Further decrees in 1860 ordered dissolution of the republic and forbade the assembly of any members of the former Congress. Norton's battle against the elected leaders of America persisted for the remainder of his life. He issued a mandate in 1862 ordering both the Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant churches to publicly ordain him as \\\"Emperor\\\", hoping to resolve the many disputes that had resulted in the Civil War.\\n\\nNorton then turned his attention to other matters, both political and social. He declared the abolition of the Democratic and Republican parties on August 12, 1869, \\\"being desirous of allaying the dissensions of party strife now existing within our realm\\\". The failure to treat Norton's adopted home city with appropriate respect is the subject of a particularly stern edict that often is cited as having been written by Norton in 1872, although evidence is elusive for the authorship, date, or source of this decree:John Lumea, \\\"On the Trail of the Elusive 'Frisco' Proclamation\\\", The Emperor's Bridge Campaign, February 12, 2016.\\n\\nNorton was occasionally a visionary, and some of his Imperial Decrees exhibited profound foresight. He issued instructions to form a League of Nations, he explicitly forbade any form of conflict between religions or their sects, and he decreed the construction of a suspension bridge or tunnel connecting Oakland and San Francisco. His later decrees, however, became increasingly irritated at the lack of prompt obedience by the authorities:\\n\\nLong after his death, similar structures were built in the form of the San Francisco\\u2013Oakland Bay Bridge and the Transbay Tube, and there have been campaigns to rename the bridge \\\"The Emperor Norton Bridge\\\".\\n\\nNorton's Imperial acts\\nthumb|left|alt=An illustration by Edward Jump depicting the funeral of the stray dog Lazarus. At the head of the many people gathered is Norton, presiding over the funeral.|A fanciful depiction of Norton dressed as the Pope at the funeral of the itinerant dog Lazarus\\nNorton spent his days inspecting San Francisco's streets in an elaborate blue uniform with gold-plated epaulettes, given to him by officers of the United States Army post at the Presidio of San Francisco. He also wore a beaver hat decorated with a peacock feather and a rosette. He frequently enhanced this imperial posture with a cane or umbrella. During his inspections, he would examine the condition of the sidewalks and cable cars, the state of repair of public property, and the appearance of police officers. He would also frequently give lengthy philosophical expositions on a variety of topics to anyone within earshot.\\n\\nDuring the 1860s and 1870s, there were occasional anti-Chinese demonstrations in the poorer districts of San Francisco, and riots took place, sometimes resulting in fatalities. During one incident, Norton allegedly positioned himself between the rioters and their Chinese targets; with a bowed head, he started reciting the Lord's Prayer repeatedly until the rioters dispersed without incident.\\n\\nNorton caricaturist Edward Jump started a rumor claiming that Norton had two dogs named Bummer and Lazarus which were also San Francisco celebrities. Norton ate at free lunch counters where he shared his meals with the dogs, although he did not own them.\\n\\nthumb|right|300px|alt=Ten dollar note|A ten dollar note issued by the Imperial Government of Norton I\\nSpecial officer Armand Barbier was part of a local auxiliary force whose members were called \\\"policemen\\\" but in fact were private security guards paid by neighborhood residents and business owners, and he arrested Norton in 1867 to commit him to involuntary treatment for a mental disorder. The arrest outraged the citizens and sparked scathing editorials in the newspapers, including the Daily Alta which wrote \\\"that he had shed no blood; robbed no one; and despoiled no country; which is more than can be said of his fellows in that line.\\\"\\\"Arrest of the Emperor,\\\" Daily Alta California, January 22, 1967. Police Chief Patrick Crowley ordered Norton released and issued a formal apology on behalf of the police force, and Norton granted an Imperial Pardon to Barbier. Police officers of San Francisco thereafter saluted him as he passed in the street.\\nNorton did receive some tokens of recognition for his position. The 1870 U.S. census lists Joshua Norton as 50 years old and residing at 624 Commercial Street, and his occupation is listed as \\\"Emperor\\\". It also notes that he was insane.\\n\\nNorton issued his own money in the form of scrips which were accepted from him by restaurants in San Francisco. These notes came in denominations between fifty cents and ten dollars, and the few surviving notes are collector's items. The city of San Francisco also honored Norton. When his uniform began to look shabby, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors bought him a suitably imperial replacement. Norton sent a gracious thank you note and issued a \\\"patent of nobility in perpetuity\\\" for each supervisor.\\n\\nLater years and death\\nNorton was the subject of many tales. One popular story suggested that he was the son of Emperor Napoleon III and that his claim of coming from South Africa was a ruse to prevent persecution.To have been an illegitimate son of Louis Napoleon, he would have to be conceived when the French Emperor was only 11. Suggestions that Norton should marry Queen Victoria can hardly be taken seriously, though he is reported to have met Emperor Pedro II of Brazil. Rumors also circulated that Norton was supremely wealthy and was feigning poverty because he was miserly.\\n\\nA number of decrees were printed in local newspapers that were probably fraudulent, and it is believed that newspaper editors themselves drafted fictitious edicts to suit their own agendas. The San Francisco Museum and Historical Society maintains a list of the decrees believed to be genuine.\\n\\nOn the evening of January 8, 1880, Norton collapsed on the corner of California Street and Dupont Street (now Grant Avenue) in front of Old Saint Mary's Cathedral while on his way to a lecture at the California Academy of Sciences. His collapse was immediately noticed, and \\\"the police officer on the beat hastened for a carriage to convey him to the City Receiving Hospital\\\", according to the next day's obituary in the San Francisco Morning Call. Norton died before a carriage could arrive. The Call reported, \\\"On the reeking pavement, in the darkness of a moonless night, under the dripping rain... Norton I, by the grace of God, Emperor of the United States and Protector of Mexico, departed this life\\\". Two days later, the San Francisco Chronicle led its article on Norton's funeral with the headline \\\"Le Roi Est Mort.\\\"John Lumea, \\\"Setting the Record Straight on the Famous Emperor Norton Obit(s),\\\" The Emperor's Bridge Campaign, December 15, 2017.\\n\\nIt quickly became evident that Norton had died in complete poverty, contrary to rumors of wealth. Five or six dollars in small change was found on his person, and a search of his room at the boarding house on Commercial Street turned up a single gold sovereign, worth around $2.50. His possessions included his collection of walking sticks, his rather battered saber, a variety of headgear including a stovepipe, a derby, a red-laced Army cap, and another cap suited to a martial band-master, an 1828 French franc, and a handful of the Imperial bonds that he sold to tourists at a fictitious 7% interest. There were fake telegrams purporting to be from Emperor Alexander II of Russia congratulating Norton on his forthcoming marriage to Queen Victoria, and from the President of France predicting that such a union would be disastrous to world peace. Also found were his letters to Queen Victoria and 98 shares of stock in a defunct gold mine.\\n\\nInitial funeral arrangements were for a pauper's coffin of simple redwood. However, members of a San Francisco businessmen's association called the Pacific Club established a funeral fund that provided for a handsome rosewood casket and arranged a dignified farewell. Norton's funeral on Sunday, January 10 was solemn, mournful, and large. Paying their respects were members of \\\"all classes from capitalists to the pauper, the clergyman to the pickpocket, well-dressed ladies and those whose garb and bearing hinted of the social outcast\\\". It was reported that as many as 10,000 people lined the streets, and that the funeral cort\\u00e8ge was two miles (3\\u00a0km) long. Norton was buried in the Masonic Cemetery at the expense of the City of San Francisco.\\n\\nIn 1934, Emperor Norton's remains were transferred to a grave site at Woodlawn Cemetery in Colma, California, as were all graves in the city.\\n\\nIn popular culture\\n\\nthumb|alt=A plaque commemorating Norton, dedicated by E Clampus Vitus on February 25, 1939, which reads \\\"Pause, traveler, and be grateful to Norton 1st, emperor of the United States and protector of Mexico, 1859-80, whose prophetic wisdom conceived and decreed the bridging of San Francisco Bay, August 18, 1869.\\\" The plaque depicts Norton, flanked to the left by the Bay Bridge and a dog labeled \\\"Bummer\\\" and to the right by a dog labeled \\\"Lazarus\\\".|This 1939 plaque commemorating Norton's role in the history of the Bay Bridge was originally at the Cliff House, San Francisco and then at the now-demolished Transbay Terminal. It now is at the Transbay Transit Center.\\n\\nDetails of Norton's life story may have been forgotten, but he was immortalized in literature. Mark Twain resided in San Francisco during part of Emperor Norton's public life, and he modeled the character of the King in Adventures of Huckleberry Finn on him. Robert Louis Stevenson made Norton a character in his 1892 novel The Wrecker. Stevenson's stepdaughter Isobel Osbourne mentioned Norton in her autobiography This Life I've Loved, stating that he \\\"was a gentle and kindly man, and fortunately found himself in the friendliest and most sentimental city in the world, the idea being 'let him be emperor if he wants to.' San Francisco played the game with him.\\\"\\n\\nSince 1974, the Imperial Council of San Francisco has been conducting an annual pilgrimage to Norton's grave in Colma, just outside San Francisco. In January 1980, ceremonies were conducted in San Francisco to honor the 100th anniversary of the death of \\\"the one and only Emperor of the United States\\\". The Emperor's Bridge Campaign is a San Francisco-based non-profit organization launched in September 2013 which engages in research, education, and advocacy to advance the legacy of Emperor Norton.Rachel Swan, \\\"The Emperor's Bridge Campaign Is Now a Nonprofit,\\\" SF Weekly, November 11, 2014. He is considered a patron saint of Discordianism, and a park in the Republic of Molossia is named \\\"Norton Park\\\".\\n\\nThe June 15, 1956 episode of the western anthology series Death Valley Days was titled, \\\"Emperor Norton\\\", who was played by Parker Garvie. The February 27, 1966 episode of the western television series Bonanza was titled \\\"The Emperor Norton\\\", who was played by Sam Jaffe. The episode also featured William Challee as Sam Clemens, aka Mark Twain.\\n\\nNorton appeared as a character in Neil Gaiman's Sandman, Vol 2, 31, \\\"Three Septembers and a January\\\".\\n\\nEfforts to name the San Francisco\\u2013Oakland Bay Bridge for Emperor Norton\\nIn 1939, the group E Clampus Vitus commissioned a plaque commemorating Emperor Norton's call for the construction of a suspension bridge between San Francisco and Oakland, via Yerba Buena Island (formerly Goat Island). The group intended to place the plaque on the recently opened San Francisco\\u2013Oakland Bay Bridge or, failing that, the new Transbay Terminal. This was not approved by the bridge authorities, however, and the plaque was installed at the Cliff House in 1955. It was moved to the Transbay Terminal in 1986, in connection with the 50th anniversary of the bridge. The Terminal was closed and demolished in 2010 as part of the project to construct a new Transbay Transit Center, and the plaque was placed in storage. After bring restored in late 2018, the plaque was rededicated and reinstalled at the new transit center in September 2019.\\\"A Plaque in 1939,\\\" The Emperor's Bridge Campaign.\\n\\nThere have been two 21st-century campaigns to name all or parts of the Bay Bridge for Emperor Norton. San Francisco District 3 Supervisor Aaron Peskin introduced a resolution to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in November 2004, after a campaign by San Francisco Chronicle cartoonist Phil Frank calling for the entire bridge to be named for Norton.Resolution in Support of the Emperor Norton Bridge  , introduced to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors by District 3 Supervisor Aaron Peskin, 2004. On December 14, 2004, the Board approved a modified version of this resolution, calling for only \\\"new additions,\\\" i.e., the planned replacement for the bridge's eastern section, to be named \\\"The Emperor Norton Bridge.\\\" Neither the City of Oakland nor Alameda County passed any similar resolution, so the effort went no further.\\n\\nIn June 2013, eight members of the California Assembly and two members of the California Senate introduced a resolution to name the western section of the bridge for former California state Speaker and San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown.California Legislature, 2013-14 Regular Session, Assembly Concurrent Resolution No. 65 \\u2014 Relative to the Willie L. Brown, Jr. Bridge, June 12, 2013. In response, there have been public efforts seeking to revive the earlier Emperor Norton effort. An online petition launched in August 2013 calls for the entire bridge system to be named for him. The petition was the impetus for the creation of The Emperor's Bridge Campaign which is carrying forward the bridge-naming effort, citing the precedent of 30 California bridges for which the state has authorized multiple names. The Campaign calls on the legislature simply to add \\\"Emperor Norton Bridge\\\" as an honorary name for the Bay Bridge, leaving in place all existing names. Currently, the organization hopes to sponsor a legislative resolution that would take effect in 2022, the 150th anniversary of Emperor Norton's proclamations of 1872, setting out the original vision for the bridge.Name It the Emperor Norton Bridge, The Emperor's Bridge Campaign.\\n\\nSee also\\n\\n Frederick Coombs\\n Or\\u00e9lie-Antoine de Tounens\\n Nicol\\u00e1s Z\\u00fa\\u00f1iga y Miranda\\n Jos\\u00e9 Sarria\\n Screaming Lord Sutch\\n Wizard of New Zealand\\n Frank Chu\\n\\nNotes\\n\\nReferences\\n \\n \\n Cowan, Robert Ernest. \\\"Norton I, Emperor of the United States and Protector of Mexico (Joshua A.
