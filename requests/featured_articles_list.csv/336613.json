"{\"title\": \"Peter Jennings\", \"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Jennings\", \"text\": \"Peter Charles Archibald Ewart Jennings  (July 29, 1938August 7, 2005) was a Canadian-American journalist who served as the sole anchor of ABC World News Tonight from 1983 until his death from lung cancer in 2005. He dropped out of high school, yet he transformed himself into one of American television's most prominent journalists.\\n\\nJennings started his career early, hosting a Canadian radio show at age 9. He began his professional career with CJOH-TV in Ottawa during its early years, anchoring the local newscasts and hosting the teen dance show Saturday Date on Saturdays. In 1965, ABC News tapped him to anchor its flagship evening news program. Critics and others in the television news business attacked his inexperience, making his job difficult. He became a foreign correspondent in 1968, reporting from the Middle East.\\n\\nJennings returned as one of World News Tonight three anchormen in 1978, and he was promoted to sole anchorman in 1983. He was also known for his marathon coverage of breaking news stories, staying on the air for 15 hours or more to anchor the live broadcast of events such as the Gulf War in 1991, the Millennium celebrations in 2000, and the September 11 attacks in 2001. In addition to anchoring, he was the host of many ABC News special reports and moderated several American presidential debates. He was always fascinated with the United States and became an American citizen in 2003.\\n\\nJennings was one of the \\\"Big Three\\\" news anchormen, along with Tom Brokaw of NBC and Dan Rather of CBS, who dominated American evening network news from the early 1980s until his death in 2005, which closely followed the retirements of Brokaw in 2004 and Rather in 2005.\\n\\nLife and career\\n\\nEarly life\\nJennings was born on July 29, 1938, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada; he and his younger sister Sarah were the only two children of Elizabeth (n\\u00e9e Osborne) and Charles Jennings, a prominent radio broadcaster for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). Peter Jennings started his broadcasting career at the age of nine, hosting Peter's People, a half-hour, Saturday morning, CBC Radio show for kids. His father was on a business trip to the Middle East when the show debuted; upon returning, Charles Jennings, who harbored a deep dislike of nepotism, was outraged to learn that the network had put his son on the air.\\n\\nWhen Jennings was 11 he began attending Trinity College School in Port Hope, Ontario, where he excelled in sports. After the CBC moved his father to its Ottawa headquarters in the early 1950s, Jennings transferred to Lisgar Collegiate Institute. He struggled academically, and Jennings later surmised that it was out of \\\"pure boredom\\\" that he failed 10th grade and dropped out. \\\"I loved girls,\\\" he said. \\\"I loved comic books. And for reasons I don't understand, I was pretty lazy.\\\"  Jennings then briefly attended Carleton University, where he says he \\\"lasted about 10 minutes\\\" before dropping out.Dare, Patrick (June 14, 1997). \\\"Impatient broadcaster savours Carleton honour\\\". The Ottawa Citizen through LexisNexis Academic, p. C3. Retrieved on January 3, 2007.  He also attended the University of Ottawa.\\n\\nAlthough Jennings dreamed of following in his father's footsteps in broadcasting, his first job was as a bank teller for the Royal Bank of Canada. He had hoped that the company would assign him to its Havana branch; instead, it located him to the small town of Prescott, Ontario, before transferring him to its nearby Brockville branch. During this time, he explored acting by appearing in several amateur musical productions with the Orpheus Musical Theatre Society, including Damn Yankees and South Pacific.\\\"Where are they now? \\\". Orpheus Musical Theatre Society. Retrieved on November 27, 2006. \\n\\nIt was in Brockville that the 21-year-old Jennings started his rise in broadcasting. In 1959, CFJR, a local radio station, hired him as a member of its news department; many of his stories were picked up by the CBC. By 1961, Jennings had joined the staff of CJOH-TV, then a new television station in Ottawa. When the station launched in March 1961, Jennings was initially an interviewer and co-producer for Vue, a late-night news program. His producers saw a youthful attractiveness in him that resembled that of Dick Clark, and Jennings soon found himself hosting Club Thirteen, a dance show similar to American Bandstand.Ward, Bruce (August 9, 2005). \\\"Canadian's wit, insight and authority made him Americans' 'centre of gravity'\\\".

Retrieved on November 27, 2006.\\n\\nThe next year, CTV, Canada's first private TV network and a fledgling competitor of his father's network, hired the 24-year-old Jennings as co-anchor of its late-night national newscast. While reporting for CTV, he was the first Canadian journalist to arrive in Dallas after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. In 1964, CTV sent Jennings to cover the Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City, New Jersey. There, he ran into Elmer Lower, then president of ABC News, who offered him a job as a correspondent for the American network, an opportunity Jennings initially rejected. \\\"The job was pretty intimidating for a guy like me in a tiny city in Canada,\\\" Jennings later recalled. \\\"I thought, What if I screw up? What if I fail?\\\" Three months later though, he changed his mind and moved to the United States.\\n\\nUnited States' youngest anchor\\nthumb|upright|1968 press photo\\nJennings started reporting for ABC at its New York news bureau. At the time, ABC lagged behind the more established news divisions of NBC and CBS, and the network was trying to attract younger viewers. On February 1, 1965, ABC plucked the fresh-faced Canadian from the field and placed him at the anchor desk of Peter Jennings With the News, then a 15-minute nightly newscast. He replaced Ron Cochran, a fellow Canadian. At 26, Jennings was, and remains, the youngest-ever U.S. network news anchor. \\\"ABC was in bad shape at the time,\\\" Jennings said. \\\"They were willing to try anything, and, to demonstrate the point, they tried me.\\\"Peter Jennings: A Reporter's Life, p. 19.\\n\\nAn inexperienced Jennings had a hard time keeping up with his rivals at the other networks, and he\\u00a0\\u2013 and the upstart ABC News\\u00a0\\u2013 could not compete with the venerable newscasts of Walter Cronkite at CBS and Chet Huntley and David Brinkley at NBC. Some in the American audience disliked Jennings's Canadian accent. He pronounced lieutenant as \\\"leftenant\\\", mangled the pronunciation of \\\"Appomattox\\\", and misidentified the \\\"Marines' Hymn\\\" as \\\"Anchors Aweigh\\\" at Lyndon Johnson's presidential inauguration; his lack of in-depth knowledge of American affairs and culture led critics to deride Jennings as a \\\"glamorcaster\\\". \\\"It was a little ridiculous when you think about it,\\\" he later reflected. \\\"A 26-year-old trying to compete with Cronkite, Huntley and Brinkley. I was simply unqualified.\\\" After three rocky years at the anchor desk, Jennings quit to become a foreign correspondent.\\n\\nForeign correspondent\\nJennings was determined to build his journalism credentials abroad. In 1968, he established ABC's Middle East bureau in Beirut, Lebanon, the first American television news bureau in the Arab world.\\\"Peter Jennings\\\". ABC News. Retrieved on November 30, 2006. The next year, he demonstrated his growing expertise in Middle Eastern affairs with Palestine: New State of Mind, a well-received half-hour documentary for ABC's Now news program. As ABC's Beirut bureau chief, Jennings soon became familiar with the intricacies of the Arab\\u2013Israeli conflict, including the rise of the Palestinian Black September Organization during the early 1970s. He conducted the first American television interview with Palestine Liberation Organization chairman Yasser Arafat. While stationed in the Lebanese capital, Jennings dated Palestinian activist Hanan Ashrawi, who was then a graduate student in literature at the American University in Beirut.Fenyvesi, Charles (December 30, 1991 / January 6, 1992). \\\"Washington whispers\\\".

Retrieved on November 30, 2006.\\n\\nIn 1972, Jennings covered his first major breaking news story, the Munich Olympics massacre of Israeli athletes by Black September. His live reporting, which drew on the expertise he had acquired in the Middle East, provided context for Americans who were unfamiliar with the Palestinian group. By hiding with his camera crew close to the athletic compound where the Israeli athletes were being held hostage, Jennings was able to provide ABC with clear video of the masked hostage-takers. He would later be criticized for insisting on using the terms \\\"guerillas\\\" and \\\"commandos\\\" instead of \\\"terrorists\\\" to describe the members of Black September.\\n\\nAfter events in Munich, Jennings continued to report on Middle East issues. In 1973, he covered the Yom Kippur War, and the following year, he served as chief correspondent and co-producer of Sadat: Action Biography, a profile of Egyptian president Anwar Sadat that would win him his first of two George Foster Peabody Awards. The documentary established Jennings as Sadat's favorite correspondent.Waite, Clayland. Jennings, Peter . The Museum of Broadcast Communications. Retrieved on December 1, 2006.

In the late 1970s, a disastrous pairing of Harry Reasoner and Barbara Walters at the anchor desk left the network searching for new ideas. Arledge decided to implement a three-anchor format for the program. On July 10, 1978, World News Tonight debuted with Frank Reynolds in Washington, Max Robinson in Chicago, and Jennings in London.Waters, Harry F. with Betsy Carter (August 20, 1979). \\\"ABC News Marches On\\\".

Jennings's official title was \\\"Foreign Desk Anchor,\\\" although he continued to serve as the network's chief foreign correspondent. By the summer of 1979, the innovative broadcast, which featured some of the same glitzy presentation as Arledge's previous television coup, Wide World of Sports, had climbed in the ratings. The newscast had gained 1.9 million households from its debut, and was now in a dead heat with NBC's evening newscast.\\n\\nJennings also found renewed success in his personal life. In 1979, he married for the third time to fellow ABC correspondent Kati Marton. That same year, he became a father when Marton gave birth to their daughter, Elizabeth. In 1982, Jennings's and Marton's second child, Christopher, was born.\\n\\nAs part of ABC's triumvirate, Jennings continued to cover major international news, especially Middle East issues. His nightly appearance at an anchor desk in London gave the impression that ABC News was more dedicated to foreign news than the other networks.Schwartz, Tony (December 12, 1981). \\\"Arledge Fights, Yet Revels in, his Outsider Status\\\" (fee required).

Jennings reported on the Iranian Revolution and subsequent hostage crisis, the assassination of Sadat, the Falklands War, Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon, and Pope John Paul II's 1983 visit to Poland. His insistence on covering the major international stories himself irked some of his fellow ABC foreign correspondents, who came to resent being scooped by what they deemed as \\\"Jennings' Flying Circus.\\\" Jennings, too, was not completely satisfied with his job in London. When his contract expired with ABC in the early 1980s, Jennings flirted with the possibility of moving back to Canada and working with the CBC on its new nightly newscast, The Journal. The CBC could not meet Jennings's renegotiation deadlines, though, and the deal fell through.Riches, Hester (June 17, 1981). \\\"CBC blew its chance to net Peter Jennings\\\".

His absence caused a dip in the ratings for ABC's nightly newscast. ABC originally expected a full recovery, and relocated Jennings to its Washington bureau to fill in for Reynolds while he was sick; the move helped buoy the newscast's ratings, though it remained in third place. On July 20, 1983, Reynolds died unexpectedly after developing acute hepatitis.\\n\\nOn August 9, 1983, ABC announced that Jennings had signed a four-year contract with the network and would become the sole anchor and senior editor for World News Tonight on September 5. Jennings would anchor the program from New York City, the program's new base of operations. The announcement signaled a generational shift in the evening news broadcasts, and the beginning of what the media would deem the \\\"Big Three\\\" era of Jennings, Dan Rather of CBS, and Tom Brokaw of NBC. Rather had already been elevated to anchor in 1981 after the retirement of Walter Cronkite, and Brokaw of NBC Nightly News was set to become sole anchor the same day as Jennings. At the time, Jennings expressed apprehension that the impending competition among the three newsmen was at risk of becoming superficial. \\\"With me, Brokaw and Rather, I recognize that there will be the factor of three pretty faces,\\\" he said. \\\"That's an inevitable byproduct of television. But if that is what it comes down to in terms of the approach we take, if our approach is that singular, then we will all have made a mistake.\\\"Smith, Sally Bedell (August 10, 1983). \\\"Peter Jennings Named Sole ABC Anchor\\\".

He spent his first year at the anchor desk educating himself on American domestic affairs in preparation for the 1984 presidential campaign season. In June 1984, Jennings, who later admitted that his political knowledge was limited at the time, co-anchored ABC's coverage of the Democratic National Convention with David Brinkley. \\\"I had not covered an election campaign in 16 years,\\\" Jennings said, \\\"so here was I going to co-anchor with David Brinkley in 1984, and he wasn't even sure I knew who the faces belonged to, and he was right.\\\"Kenney, Charles (November 6, 1988). \\\"Why Peter Jennings is So Good\\\".

Jennings was praised for his performance during the 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, when he anchored ABC's coverage of the event for 11 straight hours. By 1989, competition among the three nightly newscasts had risen to fever pitch.

Like other network news anchors, he was widely praised for guiding Americans through the disaster. At one point, Jennings broke his composure after receiving phone calls from his children. \\\"We do not very often make recommendations for people's behavior from this chair,\\\" he said, \\\"but...if you're a parent, you've got a kid in some other part of the country, call them up. Exchange observations.\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZdL_XNBcyo\\n\\nHis coverage was not without controversy. Jennings was criticized by Rush Limbaugh among others for commenting about President George W. Bush on-air: \\\"Where is the president of the United States? ... I know we don't know where he is, but pretty soon the country needs to know where he is.\\\" ABC was flooded with more than 10,000 angry phone calls and e-mails.  On September 13, Jennings received more criticism \\u2014 this time for hosting a forum for Middle East experts that included Palestinian Authority negotiator Hanan Ashrawi. In the summer of 2002, Jennings and ABC refused to allow Toby Keith to open their coverage of July 4 celebrations with \\\"Courtesy of the Red, White and Blue (The Angry American)\\\", prompting criticism from Keith and country music fans, who highlighted the anchor's Canadian citizenship.\\n\\nThe events of September 11 added new meaning to In Search of America, the project Jennings and Brewster started after the success of their previous collaboration. The two began writing the book in early 2001; after the terrorist attacks, they revisited many of the people they had interviewed to see how the events had affected them.Hogan, Ron (August 5, 2002). \\\"PW Talks with Peter Jennings and Todd Brewster\\\". Publishers Weekly through LexisNexis Academic, p. 65. Retrieved on January 18, 2007. To promote the book, the anchor and World News Tonight started a 50-state tour of the United States in April 2002 as part of a yearlong project, 50 States/One Nation/One Year. Jennings also anchored a six-part television series in September 2002, which featured the same name as the book. Despite the success of the TV series and heavy promotion by the book's publisher, In Search of America failed to generate much interest or sales.\\n\\nJennings's work on In Search of America and the September 11 attacks contributed to his decision in 2003 to become a dual citizen of Canada and the United States. \\\"I think that 9/11 and the subsequent travel I did in the country afterwards made me feel connected in new ways,\\\" he said. \\\"And when we were working on the America project I spent a lot of time on the road, which meant away from my editor's desk, and I just got much more connected to the Founding Fathers' dreams and ideas for the future.\\\"Boswell, Randy (July 8, 2003). \\\"Why Peter Jennings chose to become an American\\\". Ottawa Citizen through Friends of Canadian Broadcasting, p. A1. Retrieved on July 4, 2011. His work had prepared him well for the citizenship test, which he passed easily. \\\"Can you imagine I, who just finished a whole series on America and had been an anchorperson for an American broadcast...could you imagine if I had failed?\\\" he asked. \\\"It would have been horrendous.\\\"Johnson, Peter (July 9, 2003). \\\"Canadian Peter Jennings becomes a U.S. citizen\\\". USA Today, p. D3. Retrieved on January 18, 2007. The anchor's formal pledge of allegiance took place at a regular citizenship ceremony on May 30 in Lower Manhattan. The occasion overwhelmed him. \\\"I went in the front door and came out the front door. They were regular people. They were very touching. And I cried a little bit \\u2014 my kids didn't cry, but I cried a bit \\u2014 but I'm a fairly emotional character anyway.\\\"\\n\\nLeaving the chair\\nAs he did in 2000, Jennings moderated the 2004 Democratic presidential primary debate, which was held that year at Saint Anselm College in New Hampshire. He was noted for questioning General Wesley Clark over Clark's silence over controversial comments made by filmmaker Michael Moore, a supporter of Clark. Moore called then-President George W. Bush a \\\"deserter\\\".\\nthumb|left|Peter Jennings (center, blue shirt) while in San Francisco in 1984.\\nBy late 2004, Brokaw had retired from his anchoring duties at NBC, ceding the reins to Brian Williams; Rather planned to step down in March 2005. Jennings and ABC saw an opportunity to gain viewers, and initiated a publicity blitz touting the anchor's foreign reporting experience. However, despite having almost always reported from the scene of any major news story, Jennings was sidelined by an upper respiratory infection in late December 2004; he was forced to anchor from New York during the aftermath of the Asian tsunami, while his competitors traveled to the region. For Jennings, the situation was agonizing.Steinberg, Jacques (January 10, 2005). \\\"Reporting Live From Hell: TV Scrambles for Glory\\\". The New York Times, p. E1.

On April 1, 2005, he anchored World News Tonight for the last time; his failing health also prevented him from covering the death and funeral of Pope John Paul II. On April 5, 2005, Jennings informed viewers through a taped message on World News Tonight that he had been diagnosed with lung cancer, and was starting chemotherapy treatment the following week. \\\"As some of you now know, I have learned in the last couple of days that I have lung cancer,\\\" he said. \\\"Yes, I was a smoker until about 20 years ago, and I was weak and I smoked over 9/11. But whatever the reason, the news does slow you down a bit.\\\" Although he stated his intention to continue anchoring whenever possible, the message was to be his last appearance on television.\\n\\nThroughout the summer, Charles Gibson, co-host of Good Morning America, and Elizabeth Vargas, co-host of 20/20, served as temporary anchors. On April 29, 2005, Jennings posted a letter on ABCNews.com with an update of his status and expressing thanks to those who had offered him their good wishes and prayers.  In June, Jennings visited the ABC News headquarters, and addressed staff members in an emotional scene in the World News Tonight newsroom; he thanked Gibson for closing each broadcast with the phrase, \\\"for Peter Jennings and all of us at ABC News.\\\" During his visit, however, his colleagues noticed he was ill to the point where he could barely speak. He posted another short letter of thanks on July 29, 2005, his 67th birthday.\\n\\nDeath\\nOn August 7, 2005, just after 11:30\\u00a0pm EDT, Charles Gibson broke into local news in the eastern U.S. and regular programming on ABC's western affiliates to announce Jennings's death from lung cancer. He read a short statement from the family, and disclosed that Jennings had died in his New York apartment with his fourth wife, two children by his marriage to Kati Marton, and sister at his side. The anchor's ABC colleagues, including Barbara Walters, Diane Sawyer, and Ted Koppel, shared their thoughts on Jennings's death. The next morning, Brokaw and Rather fondly remembered their former rival on the morning news shows. \\\"Peter, of the three of us, was our prince,\\\" said Brokaw on Today. \\\"He seemed so timeless.
