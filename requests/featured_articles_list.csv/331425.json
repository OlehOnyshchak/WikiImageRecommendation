"{\"title\": \"Melodifestivalen\", \"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melodifestivalen\", \"text\": \"Melodifestivalen (; literally \\\"the Melody Festival\\\") is an annual song competition organised by Swedish public broadcasters Sveriges Television (SVT) and Sveriges Radio (SR). It determines the country's representative for the Eurovision Song Contest, and has been staged almost every year since 1958. Since 2000, the competition has been the most popular television programme in Sweden;Television in Sweden. Sweden.se (30 September 2005). Retrieved on 20 October 2006. it is also broadcast on radio and the Internet. In 2012, the semi-finals averaged 3.3\\u00a0million viewers, and over an estimated four million people in Sweden watched the final, almost half of the Swedish population.\\n\\nThe festival has produced six Eurovision winners and twenty-four top-five placings for Sweden at the contest. The winner of Melodifestivalen has been chosen by panels of jurors since its inception. Since 1999, the juries have been joined by a public telephone vote which has an equal influence over the final outcome. The competition makes a considerable impact on the music charts in Sweden.\\n\\nThe introduction of semi-finals in 2002 raised the potential number of contestants from around twelve to thirty-two. A children's version of the competition, Lilla Melodifestivalen, also began that year. Light orchestrated pop songs, known locally as schlager music, used to be so prevalent that the festival was sometimes referred to as schlagerfestivalen (\\\"the schlager festival\\\") or schlager-sm (\\\"schlager Swedish championship\\\") by the Swedish media.\\\"Jag koncentrerar mig p\\u00e5 schlagerfestivalen\\\"   [\\\"I am concentrating on schlagerfestivalen\\\"].

Sweden's first contest was the third, in 1958. Without broadcasting a public selection, Sveriges Radio (SR) chose to send Alice Babs to the contest in Hilversum, Netherlands. The song selected was \\\"Samma stj\\u00e4rna lyser f\\u00f6r oss tv\\u00e5\\\" (The same stars shine for the two of us), later renamed \\\"Lilla stj\\u00e4rna\\\" (Little star).Leif Thorsson. Melodifestivalen genom tiderna [\\\"Melodifestivalen through time\\\"] (2006), p.\\u00a012. Stockholm: Premium Publishing AB.  It finished fourth at Eurovision on 12 March 1958.\\n\\nThe first Melodifestival, incorporated into the S\\u00e4g det med musik radio series, took place on 29 January 1959 at Cirkus in Stockholm; eight songs participated. Four \\\"expert\\\" juries in Stockholm, Gothenburg, Malm\\u00f6, and Lule\\u00e5 decided the winner.Thorsson, p.\\u00a019 The competition was won by Siw Malmkvist performing \\\"Augustin\\\", but SR decided that the winning song\\u2014regardless of its original performer\\u2014would be performed by Brita Borg at Eurovision. This policy, of selecting the artist for Eurovision internally and having other artists perform potential Swedish entries at Melodifestivalen, was stopped in 1961. The competition became a stand-alone television programme in 1960, known as the Eurovisionschlagern, svensk final. In the event's early years, it was broadcast to Norway and Denmark through the Nordvision network.Thorsson, p.\\u00a017. The competition adopted its current name, Melodifestivalen, in 1967.\\n\\nMelodifestivalen has failed to be staged on three occasions. In 1964, the competition was cancelled due to an artist's strike; Sweden did not send a song to Eurovision that year.Thorsson, pp.\\u00a048\\u201349. Sweden was absent at Eurovision for a second time in 1970 because of a Nordic boycott of the voting system, which had led to a four-way tie for first place at the 1969 contest.Thorsson, pp.\\u00a082\\u201383. After SR staged the 1975 contest in Stockholm, left-wing groups argued that Sweden should not spend money to win and host Eurovision again. This led to mass demonstrations against commercial music and the organisation of an anti-commercial Alternativfestivalen.Thorsson, pp.\\u00a0118\\u2013119. Therefore, Sweden decided not to send a song to Eurovision 1976 but returned in 1977.\\n\\n Participation \\n\\nthumb|left|Charlotte Perrelli, the 2008 winner of Melodifestivalen, performing at the Eurovision Song Contest in Belgrade\\nHundreds of songs and performers have entered Melodifestivalen since its debut. Although songwriters living outside Sweden were once not allowed to enter Melodifestivalen, the 2012 contest marked the first time foreign songwriters could submit entries, provided that they collaborated with a Swedish songwriter. To be eligible, songwriters and performers must be at least sixteen years of age on the day of the first Eurovision semi-final.Melodifestivalen 2007\\u2014T\\u00e4vlingsregler  [\\\"Melodifestivalen 2007\\u2014Competition rules\\\"]. Sveriges Television AB (May 2006). Retrieved on 21 October 2006.\\n\\nUntil 2001, participation in the festival was limited to a single night. The number of contestants ranged from five to twelve. A two-round system was used intermittently between 1981 and 1998, in which all but five of the contestants were eliminated in the first round of voting. Failure to reach the second round under this system was seen as a major failure for a prominent artist; when Elisabeth Andreassen failed to qualify in 1984, it almost ended her career.Thorsson, p.\\u00a0171. The introduction of weekly semi-finals in 2002 increased the number of contestants to thirty-two. At least ten of the contestants must perform in Swedish. A CD of each year's competing songs has been released since 2001, and a DVD of the semi-finals and final since 2003.\\n\\nMelodifestivalen has been the launch-pad for the success of popular local acts, such as ABBA, Tommy K\\u00f6rberg, and Lisa Nilsson. The competition has played host to performers from outside Sweden, including Baccara, Alannah Myles, Katrina Leskanich, and Cornelis Vreeswijk.

While local success for Melodifestivalen winners is common, most contestants return to obscurity and few have major international success. The impact that the competition makes on the Swedish charts means an artist need not win the competition to earn significant domestic record sales. For example, the song which finished last at Melodifestivalen 1990, \\\"Symfonin\\\" by Loa Falkman, topped the Swedish singles chart.Thorsson, p.\\u00a0213. The most recent occurrence was 2016 with Samir & Viktor's song \\\"Bada Nakna\\\".

SVT directly selects fourteen entries from amongst the submissions from the public at large. Thirteen additional entries come from special invitations made by SVT or other entries that SVT has selected from amongst the submissions. Finally, the twenty-eighth entry is selected via the \\\"Svensktoppen N\\u00e4sta\\\" competition. At least 10% of the final twenty-eight songs are sung in Swedish. The entire process can begin as early as May of the previous year and is finished by January.\\n\\n Songs \\n\\nSVT begins looking for songs nine months before the start of the televised Melodifestival (within days of the previous year's Eurovision final).Sietse Bakker (26 May 2006). SVT announces Melodifestivalen 2007 . ESCtoday.com. Retrieved on 21 October 2006. The deadline for submission is in September and songs can be in any language. In the pre-selection, song length is limited to three minutes and twenty seconds; songs must be shortened to three minutes if they reach the final twenty-eight and qualifying songs may also be remixed.\\n\\nThe submission process is overseen by members of the Swedish Music Publishers Association (SMFF), whose task is to reduce the number of songs, which have numbered over 3,000 a year since 2002, to around 1,200. The 3,440 entries received in the preselection for Melodifestivalen 2009 is the most in the competition's history. The SMFF's choices are then given to a sixteen-person jury of music professionals, SVT staff and other members of the public.Melodifestivalen 2006\\u2014selection . ESC.info.se. Retrieved on 21 October 2006. The jury ranges from teenagers to people in their fifties.Melodifestivalen 2007. ESC.info.se. Retrieved on 20 April 2007.  The songs that qualify, along with their composers and lyricists, are announced at the end of September. This is often followed by fervent speculation over who will perform the songs. Songwriters that qualify must provide interviews to SVT, attend a press conference before the competition, and remain open to promotional appearances if their song reaches the final.\\n\\n Artists and wildcards \\nSVT selects performers for the entries. Artists who perform the demo of a song automatically enter the competition; they must perform their songs if suitable alternate performers cannot be found. The artists' songs risk disqualification if they refuse. In the past, this rule led to the disqualification of, among others, Carola's \\\"N\\u00e4r l\\u00f6ven faller\\\" in 2003 and Stephen Simmonds's \\\"So Good\\\" in 2006.Sietse Bakker (17 December 2002).

The contestants that will perform the twenty-eight qualifiers from the preselection are announced in late November. Singer-songwriters are common.

Ten songs comprise the final: two automatic qualifiers from each of the semifinals, and the two most popular songs in the Second Chance round. In 2015, there are seven songs for each semifinal, and twelve (eight winners and four from Andra Chansen) in the final.\\n\\n Semifinals and Second Chance \\nPrior to the introduction of the current format of semifinals (delt\\u00e4vlingar) in 2002, the competition was usually a single live show. Under the current system, four semifinals are broadcast at 20:00\\u00a0CET on consecutive Saturday nights. The semi-finals begin in early February, and seven songs compete in each show.\\n\\nUnlike in the final, no juries are used; televoting decides the results. The songs are performed live with telephone lines open for the first round of voting; two songs with the fewest votes do not qualify to the second round. The top five battle for a place in the final and Andra chansen round \\u2013 the 1st and 2nd placed songs qualifying to the final, and the 3rd and 4th placed songs progressing to Andra chansen.\\nBoth finalists reprise their entries at the end of the broadcast. The organisation of a semi-final system for Melodifestivalen popularised televised heats at national Eurovision selections.Svante Stockselius. Melodifestivalen genom tiderna (2006), foreword p.\\u00a05. A similar system was adopted by the Eurovision itself in 2004.\\n\\nThe Second Chance round (Andra chansen) is the fifth heat in which the remaining four entries to the final are chosen. The third- and fourth-placed songs from each semi-final (eight songs in total) compete in the event. The first Second Chance round in 2002 had a panel of former winners decide the two finalists.Thorsson, p.\\u00a0299. Between 2003 and 2006, the semi-final performances were re-broadcast, and a round of voting narrowed the songs to three or four. Another round then determined the two finalists. The programme was broadcast on the Sunday afternoon after the fourth semi-final. It was held in a smaller venue than those that would have hosted the semi-finals\\u2014such as Berns Salonger in Stockholm, which hosted the Second Chance round in 2005.\\n\\nIn 2007, the Second Chance round became a full semi-final, taking place in a venue comparable in size to those hosting the others. The expanded Second Chance takes place on a Saturday night, adding an extra week to the event's timetable.Melodifestivalens cup   [\\\"Melodifestivalen's cup\\\"]. SVT.se (11 August 2006). Retrieved on 28 April 2007. The format of voting also changed with the introduction of a knock-out system. The system pairs the eight songs off against each other, then narrows them down to four before pairing them off again. The winners of the two-second round pairings go through to the final. The two finalists do not reprise their songs at the end of the programme.\\n\\nIn 2015, the system was changed again. The eight songs are divided into four duels, with one song from each duel qualifying into the final, bringing the number of finalists to 12.\\n\\n Final \\nThe final takes place at 20:00\\u00a0CET on a Saturday in mid-March. Twelve songs (11 songs in 2009, 10 before 2015) participate, two from each semifinal, four from the Second Chance round, and, only in 2009,  the international jury's choice.

The points scored by each entry are shown on a graphic scoreboard.Before the introduction of the current voting system in 1999, a group of regional or age-based juries decided the winner of Melodifestivalen. In 1993, televoting was used experimentally but proved unsuccessful. The Swedish telephone network collapsed due to the number of calls, and claims by the Swedish tabloid press suggested the use of televoting had drastically altered the results. Evening newspapers released what they claimed to be the back-up juries' votes, which showed that the winner, Arvingarna's \\\"Eloise\\\", would have finished fourth had the juries' votes counted. SVT never confirmed the accuracy of these claims.The tabloid's \\\"winner\\\" was Nick Borgen's \\\"We are All the Winners\\\". Thorsson, p.\\u00a0233.\\n\\nright|thumb|SVT has eleven regional news districts, which have been represented by a jury in the final of Melodifestivalen in past editions.\\nThe current voting format introduced in 1999 is a positional voting system, similar to that used at the Eurovision Song Contest. The voting is made up of two segments, in the first of which juries announce their votes; in the second segment, the televoting result is announced. The total value of votes has usually been 2 x 473 points (2 x 638 since 2018), which means that tele-votes and juries have an equal 50/50 weighing in the final result. The juries, usually 11, have represented either Swedish regions or, since 2010, countries participating in the year's Eurovision Song Contest. Until 2017, each jury awarded 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 points to their top seven songs; however, since 2018, the points have been changed to 1 to 7, 8, 10 and 12 points. After the jury voting, the televoting result is revealed by the hosts in ascending order. Between 1999 and 2010, the televoting points were fixed; the top seven songs would receive 11, 22, 44, 66, 88, 110 and 132 points. Starting in 2011, televoting points are given to each entry based on its percentage of the total vote. If an entry receives 10% of the tele-votes it will be equivalent to 10% of 473 points, i.e. 48 points (or 638 and 64 points respectively since 2018). The song with the highest number of points at the end of the voting is the winner.\\n\\nTelephone lines open immediately after the radio preview for the final and do not close until the juries have voted.Melodifestivalen 2006\\u2014ikv\\u00e4ll avg\\u00f6rs det!
