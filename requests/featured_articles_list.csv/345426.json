"{\"title\": \"Flag of Singapore\", \"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Singapore\", \"text\": \"The national flag of Singapore was adopted in 1959, the year Singapore became self-governing within the British Empire. It was reconfirmed as the national flag when the republic gained independence on 9 August 1965. Prior to its independence, it was the only state flag in Malaysia not to have a 1:2 ratio. The design is a horizontal bicolour of red above white, overlaid in the canton (upper-left quadrant) by a white crescent moon facing a pentagon of five small white five-pointed stars. The elements of the flag denote a young nation on the ascendant, universal brotherhood and equality, and national ideals.\\n\\nVessels at sea do not use the national flag as an ensign. Merchant vessels and pleasure craft fly a civil ensign of red charged in white with a variant of the crescent and stars emblem in the centre. Non-military government vessels such as coast guard ships fly a state ensign of blue with the national flag in the canton, charged with an eight-pointed red and white compass rose in the lower fly. Naval warships fly a naval ensign similar to the state ensign, but in white with a red compass rose emblem.\\n\\nRules defined by the Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem Act govern the use and display of the national flag. These have been relaxed to allow citizens to fly the flag from vehicles during national holidays and from homes at any time of the year.\\n\\nHistory\\nalt=A British Blue Ensign (a blue flag with the Union Jack placed at the top left corner) charged with the badge of the Straits Settlements (red diamond with an inverted white Y; inside that inverted Y is three crowns.|thumb|Flag for the Straits Settlements from 1874 until 1942\\n\\nSingapore was under British rule in the 19th century, having been amalgamated into the Straits Settlements together with Malacca and Penang. The flag that was used to represent the Settlements was a British Blue Ensign containing three gold crowns\\u2014one for each settlement\\u2014separated by a red inverted pall, which resembles an inverted Y.\\n\\nThe Settlement of Singapore had no separate flag, although the city was granted a coat of arms which featured a lion in 1911. During the occupation of Singapore by the Japanese during the Second World War, the Japanese national flag was used on land by the military and during public events. Soon after the Second World War, Singapore became an independent Crown colony and adopted its own flag. It was modified from the Straits Settlements flag to reduce the number of crowns from three to one.\\n\\nalt=A British Blue Ensign (a blue flag with the Union Jack placed at the top left corner) charged with the badge of Singapore.|thumb|Flag of the Crown colony of Singapore from 1946 to 1952\\nalt=A British Blue Ensign (a blue flag with the Union Jack placed at the top left corner) charged with the badge of Singapore.|thumb|Flag of the Crown colony of Singapore from 1952 to 1959\\n\\nSingapore became self-governing within the British Empire on 3 June 1959. Six months later, upon the installation of the new Yang di-Pertuan Negara (head of state) on 3 December 1959, the national flag was officially adopted, along with the state coat of arms and the national anthem Majulah Singapura (\\\"Onward Singapore\\\"). Then-Deputy Prime Minister Toh Chin Chye discussed the creation of the national flag in a 1989 interview:\\n\\nThe design of the flag was completed in two months by a committee headed by Toh. He initially wanted the flag's entire background to be red, but the Cabinet decided against this, as red was regarded as a rallying point for communism. According to an account given by Lee Kuan Yew, the Chinese population wanted five stars, which were modelled off the flag of the People's Republic of China and the Muslim population wanted a crescent moon. Both of these symbols were combined to create the national flag of Singapore.\\n\\nOn 30 November 1959, the Singapore State Arms and Flag and National Anthem Ordinance 1959 was passed to regulate the use and display of the State Arms and State Flag and the performance of the National Anthem.Singapore State Arms and Flag and National Anthem Ordinance 1959 (No. 70 of 1959), now the . When presenting the motion to the Legislative Assembly of Singapore on 11 November 1959, Sinnathamby Rajaratnam, the Minister for Culture, stated: \\\"National flags, crest and anthem express symbolically the hopes and ideals of a people... The possession of a national flag and crest is, for a people, symbolic of self-respect.\\\"\\n\\nIn September 1962, the people of Singapore voted to join the Federation of Malaysia. The process was completed on 16 September 1963, when the Malaysian flag was hoisted on Singapore by Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew. The Singapore flag was reconfirmed as the national flag when Singapore became fully independent from Malaysia on 9 August 1965.\\n\\nDesign\\nthumb|The waving national flag\\n\\nThe Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem Rules define the flag's composition and the symbolism of its elements: red symbolises \\\"universal brotherhood and equality of man\\\", and white, \\\"pervading and everlasting purity and virtue\\\". The waxing crescent moon \\\"represents a young nation on the ascendant\\\". The five stars \\\"stand for the nation's ideals of democracy, peace, progress, justice and equality\\\". During the second half of the 20th century, the star and crescent symbol came to be recognised as a symbol of Islam, and Singapore's flag came to be seen in this context by the nation's Muslim activists.; Syed Muhd Khairudin Aljunied, 'The Role of Hadramis in Post-Second World War Singapore\\u00a0\\u2013 A Reinterpretation', Immigrants & Minorities 25, 2, p. 167. Singapore and Nepal are the only non-Muslim nations to have a crescent moon in their national flags.\\n\\nThe ratio of the flag is two units high by three units wide. For the manufacturing of flags, the Government of Singapore stated that the shade of red used on the flag is Pantone 032. According to guidelines published by the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts (MICA), the flag may be reproduced in any size and displayed at all times, but it must be in its specified proportions and colours. MICA recommends the sizes ,  and . The material that is recommended for the national flag is bunting wool.\\n\\nRegulations and guidelines\\nthumb|250px|alt=A mass event where people are waving the flag at a stadium|Spectators with national flags at the 2007 National Day Parade\\n\\nUntil 2004, the flag was used exclusively on or in front of buildings owned by the government, ministries, statutory boards and educational institutions on a year-round basis. The flag could only be flown by individuals and non-governmental organisations during the month of August to mark the country's national day on 9 August. During the National Day celebrations period (1 July \\u2013 30 September), rules governing the flying of the national flag outside buildings are relaxed.Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem Rules, r. 5(3). The flag may be displayed on any vehicle (other than a hearse), vessel or aircraft,Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem Rules, r. 6(3). and may be incorporated as part of any costume or attire, so long as this is done in a respectful manner.Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem Rules, r. 9(5).\\n\\nThese restrictions on individuals and non-governmental organisations were relaxed in 2004 to allow the flag to be flown year-round under certain conditions. A statement from the Ministry of Information and the Arts (now MICA, the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts) said that \\\"[t]he national flag, national anthem and Singapore lion head... are our most visible symbols of our sovereignty, pride and honour\\\" and urged Singaporeans to use those \\\"rallying\\\" symbols to \\\"identify with the nation\\\".\\n\\nNo rationale was provided for the changes, although BBC News correspondents noted that the government had recently been trying to rally patriotic sentiment dampened by economic issues. (In 2003, unemployment in Singapore reached a 17-year-high of 5.9%, and the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in East Asia seriously affected the island's tourist trade, causing Singapore Airlines to suffer a financial loss for the first time in its history.)

MICA permitted them to display the flag on vehicles and on themselves or belongings with minimal restrictions, from the middle of July to the end of August for a trial period. The period was extended in 2007 to three months from July to September.\\n\\nSingaporean citizens, government and non-governmental organisations may display or fly the national flag throughout the year to identify themselves with the nation, and especially encouraged to do so during occasions of national celebration or national significance. Non-Singaporean businesses and organisations are also allowed to display the flag throughout the year. The use and display of the flag is governed by Part III of the Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem Rules as amended by Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem (Amendment) Rules 2007  (S 377/2007) made under the Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem Act. It is an offence to knowingly contravene specified provisions of the Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem Rules; the penalty is a fine not exceeding S$1,000.Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem Rules, r. 14(2). The rule states: \\\"Any person who knowingly\\u00a0\\u2014 (a) does any act in relation to the Flag in contravention of the provisions of rule 5, 6, 7, 9(1), (2), (3) or (4) or 10(1); or (b) contravenes rule 8 or 9(6) in relation to the Flag, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $1,000.\\\" Treating the Flag with disrespect is a separate offence under r. 14(4), which states: \\\"Any person, who without reasonable excuse, contravenes rule 4... shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $1,000.\\\" An authorised officer may compound these offences by collecting from the person reasonably suspected of having committed the offence a sum of money not exceeding S$500: Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem (Composition of Offences) Rules 2007 (S 378/2007).\\n\\nThe Singaporean government dictates that no person may treat the national flag with disrespect,Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem Rules, r. 4(1). such as allowing the flag to touch the ground.Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem Rules, r. 4(2).

However, some Singaporeans decline to do so as they associate it with the People's Action Party, the ruling party in Parliament, rather than with the nation. During the period beginning 1 July and ending on 30 September of each year, any person may, without the need for the approval of the Minister under paragraph (4), incorporate the Flag or an image thereof as part of any costume or attire except that he shall do so in a manner that does not give rise to any disrespect to the Flag.\\n\\nOn National Day in 2007 at the Padang, 8,667 volunteers holding up red and white umbrellas formed the largest-ever representation of Singapore's flag at an event organised by Young NTUC, a youth movement associated with the National Trades Union Congress.\\n\\nAt other times\\nthumb|alt=Different types of flags and banners being flown at a structure in Istana Park.|The national flag, along with banners, flown at Istana Park\\nOutside the National Day celebrations period, the national flag of Singapore is flown from all buildings housing government and government-related departments, such as armed forces installations, court houses, offices, and educational institutions. A picture of the flag is commonly found in each classroom, and schools conduct ceremonies at the beginning of the school day at which the national flag is raised, the national anthem is sung and the national pledge is taken.See, for instance, the following: para. 22 of  Paragraph 18 of  Paragraph 3 of \\n\\nThe national flag is sometimes flown by Singapore-registered vessels, although this is considered incorrect, as such vessels are required to hoist proper national colours either when entering or leaving port.Section 37(1) of the . A master of a Singapore ship who fails without reasonable cause to comply with this section is guilty of an offence and is liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding S$1,000: s. 37(2). If any distinctive national colours other than the government ensign are hoisted on board any Singapore ship without official consent, the master of the ship or the owner if on board the ship\\u2014 as well as every other person hoisting the colours\\u2014 are guilty of an offence, and are liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding S$1,000: s. 36(2). The ensign is red and charged with a circle enclosing a crescent surmounted by five stars in a circle, all in white. The national flag is not used by coast guard ships and military warships; both classes of ships have their own specific ensigns.\\n\\nThe Singapore Government makes announcements regarding the lowering of the flag to half-mast in the event of a death of an important personage or mourning affecting the nation. The flag has been flown at half-mast during the funerals of former presidents and senior politicians,For instance, after the death of former Second Deputy Prime Minister (1980\\u20131985) and later Senior Minister (1985\\u20131988) S.

The lyrics of the song speak of a new moon, five stars and a new flag \\\"arising out of the stormy sea\\\". The moon is \\\"[y]outhful and bright and bearing hope, and tranquil as can be\\\", each of the stars is \\\"a lamp to guide our way; a lamp for all to see\\\" and the flag is \\\"[c]rimson as the blood of all mankind, yet white and pure and free\\\". See also List of Singaporean patriotic songs. The song is often sung during National Day celebrations.\\n\\nIn January 2003, Singaporean artist Justin Lee Chee Kong was prevented by the Media Development Authority (MDA) from exhibiting a painting entitled Double Happiness\\u2014 A Fantasy in Red, which consisted of an image of the Singapore flag with various red images of the Chinese characters for double happiness. The move was made on the grounds that \\\"the National Flag is a national symbol and no words or graphics should be superimposed on it\\\".\\n\\nLee reported that the work was simply a display of one's love for their country and an expression of joy at Singapore's success, and in a press statement, he asked that the piece be \\\"treated as an artistic and complimentary interpretation of a national icon\\\". When interviewed by The New Paper, he said \\\"I know as a citizen that we are not allowed to do it, but this is art and I am an artist.\\\" He also complained about double standards as a Chinese artist, Gu Wen Da, had recently exhibited a national flag made of hair at the Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay. Lee felt the use of hair to create the nation's flag meant that the flag was in the wrong colours, and was distasteful.\\n\\nAlso in 2003, The Rolling Stones performed in Singapore as part of their 2002/2003 Licks World Tour. At the first performance, there were two inflatable dolls on stage. Both of the dolls had flags placed in their crotch area; one had the Rolling Stones logo and the other had a Singapore flag. Because of the illegal use of the state flag, and for fear of dealing with the government, the dolls and the flags were removed from the second concert by the organiser.\\n\\nIn August 2007, a Singaporean pub, Loof, sent an electronic direct mailer (e-flyer) to at least 1,500 members on its mailing list featuring a close-up shot of the crotch of a female model wearing a red swimsuit or pair of underpants bearing the crescent and five stars of the national flag. This was done as part of the pub's publicity campaign for its National Day events. According to Loof's marketing manager, \\\"[T]he ad was definitely not meant as an insult to the country or anyone. I hope that the ad will be taken in the spirit of humour and fun.\\\"\\n\\nA majority of people polled by The New Paper felt the advertisement was disrespectful and in bad taste. MICA said that the advertisement did not breach the law as it only reproduced some components of the flag\\u2014it did not, for example, incorporate the flag's red and white background together. However, K.U. Menon, director of MICA's National Resilience Division, said: \\\"MICA does not encourage such ads which treat the national flag with disrespect. [...] Symbols should be treated with some measure of dignity and we hope Loof will withdraw the ad on its own initiative.\\\"\\n\\nIn November 2010, during the Asian Games held in China, the Singaporean men's water polo team's swim trunks came under controversy for inappropriately displaying elements of the Singaporean Flag. Critics deemed the garment insulting and an embarrassment to the country, with the crescent moon positioned in the centre of the brief, directly over the crotch area. The garment had been designed by the team itself but had not received prior approval from the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts. However, even after the controversy came to light, the team was still able to continue wearing it as competition rules did not permit changing a team's uniform midway through the Games. The team was apologetic over the blunder and promised to tweak the design after that competition.\\n\\nOther flags of Singapore\\n\\nIn addition to the national flag and ensigns, there are other flags used for official purposes.\\n\\nFlagDescription150px|alt=A white crescent and five stars (arranged in a pentagon) centred on a red background|The standard of the President of SingaporeThe standard used by the President of Singapore is a modification of the national flag. The crescent and the stars are bigger and centred on a field of red. According to the Istana, the Office of the President of Singapore, the red background and the crescent and stars have the same symbolism as in the national flag. The standard is flown at the Istana from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm, or until the President has left for his/her private residence.150px|alt=A white crescent and five stars (arranged in a pentagon), surrounded by a ring of white, centred on a red background|The civil ensign of SingaporeThe Red Ensign of Singapore, which is used for Singapore-registered civilian ships, is a red flag charged with a crescent and five stars, surrounded by a ring.
