"{\"title\": \"Nottingham Panthers\", \"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham_Panthers\", \"text\": \"The Nottingham Panthers are a British professional ice hockey club based in Nottingham, England. They are members of the Elite Ice Hockey League. Their main team sponsor is the Nottingham Building Society.\\n\\nThe Nottingham Panthers have won four league titles (two English National League titles, one British National League title and one Elite Ice Hockey League title), five Championships, six Autumn Cups and eight Challenge Cups during their history. Panthers are the only British team to win European club honours with one Continental Cup. They are the only team to have played in every season where a British league championship has been contested and are the only founding member of the Premier Division in 1983 to have continually participated in the top flight league. The Panthers have 16 members enshrined in the British Ice Hockey Hall of Fame and have had 34 players represent Great Britain at the World Championships and in Olympic qualifying.\\n\\nThe club was founded in 1946 after earlier attempts to establish a team were postponed due to World War II. During their first eight seasons the Panthers played in the English National League. They joined the newly formed British National League in 1954, which they competed in until its disbandment in 1960. With no league to play in the club also ceased operations. In 1980, players and officials from the Sheffield Lancers relocated to Nottingham and reformed the Panthers. Both the original and modern Nottingham Panthers played their home games at the Ice Stadium until 2000 when the team moved into the National Ice Centre.\\n\\nThe Nottingham Panthers have one of the largest fanbases in British ice hockey, averaging over 5,000 spectators per game during the 2014\\u201315 season. Their supporters have shared a number of rivalries with other teams during their history. Currently the Panthers have a fierce rivalry with the Sheffield Steelers. The two sides have played over 200 games, including eleven major finals, since 1992.\\n\\n History \\n\\n 1946\\u201360: Original era \\n\\nAn initial attempt to bring a professional ice hockey team to Nottingham was made in 1939 following the completion of the Ice Stadium in Nottingham City Centre. A team was assembled and brought to the United Kingdom from Canada to compete in the 1939\\u201340 English National League season but were promptly sent home having not played a single game due to the outbreak of World War II. Seven years later, after the war had ended, a second effort to bring ice hockey to the city was begun. With a team of Canadians largely from Winnipeg, Manitoba, the Nottingham Panthers played their first competitive game on 22 November 1946 with a 3\\u20132 home victory over the Wembley Monarchs.\\n\\nThe Panthers struggled during their early years and only once during their first four seasons did they finish in the upper half of the league table. The club's first coach, Alex Archer, left Nottingham after two seasons and was replaced by Archie Stinchcombe who would coach the team until 1955. Despite a lack of success in their formative years the team had a number of players who would become local heroes including forwards Les Strongman and Chick Zamick. Zamick became one of the most prolific scorers in the league and won the Nottingham Sportsman of the Year award on two occasions, defeating sportsmen such as the Notts County and England international footballer Tommy Lawton.\\n\\nThe club's first major title came in the 1950\\u201351 season. After finishing fourth in the Autumn Cup the Panthers won 18 of their 30 league games and clinched the league championship. The team also ended the campaign having scored the most goals and conceded the least. The following season Nottingham lost Chick Zamick to injury and fell to the bottom of the rankings. Success returned in 1953\\u201354 when, after a last place finish in the Autumn Cup, the Panthers secured their second English League title by one point over Streatham.\\n\\nIn the close season of 1954 the English League and the Scottish League were merged to form a British League. The Panthers finished second to the Harringay Racers in the eleven team competition. After one season all the Scottish teams, with the exception of the Paisley Pirates, withdrew from the British League and left it with only five members. The close season of 1955 also saw the departure of Stinchcombe who was replaced as coach by Zamick. The 1955\\u201356 season proved to be one of the club's most successful. Nottingham won the Autumn Cup at the beginning of the season before clinching their third league title on goal average ahead of the Wembley Lions. They also travelled to Sweden where they won the Ahearne Cup.\\n\\nThe 1955\\u201356 title win proved to be the original Panthers' last. Over the next four years Nottingham alternated between bottom and second place in the league standings. After finishing runner-up in 1959\\u201360, the Panthers took part in the first British Championship final in thirty years where they faced the Brighton Tigers. Nottingham were defeated 3\\u20132 in the first leg but won the second in regulation time by the same scoreline forcing overtime. The Tigers clinched the tie 6\\u20135 after six minutes and 32 seconds of the extra session. During the close season of 1960 the British National League collapsed and the Nottingham Panthers were disbanded. Ice hockey would not return to Nottingham for the next two decades.\\n\\n 1980\\u2013present: Modern era \\n\\n Ice Stadium years \\n\\nThe Nottingham Panthers were revived largely thanks to the efforts of Gary Keward. In 1980 the Ice Stadium directors, led by Charles Walker, agreed to a request by Keward to give ice hockey another chance. The Sheffield Lancers, a team Keward helped to run, were relocated to Nottingham taking the name of the team that had occupied the same building 20 years earlier. On 20 September 1980 the modern Panthers took to the ice for the first time defeating the Solihull Barons 7\\u20134 at the Ice Stadium.\\n\\nDuring their first three seasons the Panthers played in regional leagues, first in the English League South and then in Section B of the British Hockey League. In 1983 the British Hockey League reconstituted itself into the first truly national ice hockey league for 23 years and Nottingham became one of nine founder members of the league's Premier Division. The Panthers were one of the best supported teams in the league with games regularly selling out but success on the ice eluded them as the team struggled against more established opponents such as the Durham Wasps and the Murrayfield Racers. It was not until the appointment of Alex Dampier as coach in 1985 that the team's fortunes began to change. In his first season Dampier led Nottingham to the playoffs for the first time since reforming. The Panthers lost all four of their quarter final group games and failed to advance to the finals at Wembley Arena.\\n\\nIn 1986 Nottingham secured their first trophy since reforming and their first overall in thirty years when they defeated the Fife Flyers 5\\u20134 in overtime to win the Norwich Union Trophy at the NEC in Birmingham in front of a crowd of . Layton Eratt scored the winning goal after one minute and 53 seconds of the extra session in a game that had seen both the Panthers and the Flyers lead twice. In the league Nottingham again succeeded in qualifying for the playoffs but again failed to register a point. The team repeated this in the Championships the following season bringing the number of consecutive playoff defeats to twelve.\\n\\nIn 1988\\u201389 the Panthers enjoyed one of their most successful seasons. They finished third in the league and were not only able to register their first win in the playoffs but also advance to the finals at Wembley for the first time. Nottingham met Whitley Warriors in the semi final, winning the match 8\\u20136. In the final the following day the Panthers defeated the Ayr Bruins 6\\u20133, clinching their first Championship title. Another Autumn Cup followed in 1991 but Dampier left the club during the 1992\\u201393 season to join the newly formed Sheffield Steelers. He was replaced by Kevin Murphy who coached the team for the remainder of the campaign. Murphy was in turn replaced by Mike Blaisdell during the close season of 1993.\\n\\nBlaisdell assembled a strong team for the 1994\\u201395 season and led the Panthers to the Benson & Hedges Cup with a 7\\u20132 victory over the Cardiff Devils in the final. Nottingham opened their league campaign with a 21-game unbeaten run but four defeats over the final two weekends of the regular season, including an 8\\u20136 home defeat by nearest rivals and eventual champions Sheffield, denied the club their first league championship in 39 years. During the 1995\\u201396 season the Panthers made it to both the Benson & Hedges Cup and playoff finals, but they were defeated on each occasion by the Steelers.\\n\\nIn 1996 the Panthers became a founder member of the new Ice Hockey Superleague. The new league abolished the wage cap and restrictions on the number of non-British trained players a club was allowed. Many of Nottingham's British players, who had risen through the ranks of the club's youth development system, were dropped in favour of North American imports. Of Nottingham's locally trained contingent only Randall Weber, Ashley Tait and Simon Hunt were retained. The Panthers began the season by qualifying for the Benson & Hedges Cup final for a third straight year following a 6\\u20133 aggregate victory over archrival Sheffield at the semi final stage. In the final they defeated the Ayr Scottish Eagles 5\\u20133, taking the lead 29 seconds into the game and never relinquishing it. The Panthers finished fourth in the league and qualified for the last four in the playoffs after finishing top of their group with five wins and one overtime loss from six games. Their semi final against the Ayr Scottish Eagles became the longest game in British ice hockey history. The scores were level at 5\\u20135 after regulation time and each of the following five periods of ten-minute overtime ended goalless. Only in the sixth period of overtime, with the two-hour mark of the match nearing, did Jeff Hoad finally score a shorthanded winner for Nottingham ending the game after 115 minutes and 49 seconds. In the final the Panthers met Sheffield where they were defeated 3\\u20131 after taking an early lead.\\n\\nIn 1997 the Panthers franchise was sold after directors revealed the club was in considerable debt. A buyer was found in London based businessman Neil Black and his sports management company. The 1998\\u201399 season saw the Panthers sign one of their strongest ever line-ups. After finishing third in their Benson & Hedges Cup group, the Panthers eliminated the Slough Jets and Newcastle Riverkings before defeating the Manchester Storm in the semi final despite being depleted by injuries and facing a full strength Storm side. The final saw the Panthers taking on the Ayr Scottish Eagles in a repeat of the 1996 final. Here Nottingham came from behind to defeat the Eagles 2\\u20131 with Finn Pekka Virta scoring both goals. In the league the Panthers finished in third place, twelve points behind champions Manchester. Nottingham also qualified for the finals of the Challenge Cup and the playoffs but the team were defeated by the Sheffield Steelers and Cardiff Devils respectively. During the course of the season Paul Adey and Greg Hadden scored 141 points between them, four players scored more than 20 goals, six players earned more than 30 assists and seven players achieved 30 or more points.\\n\\nThe 1999\\u201300 season was the club's final year at the Ice Stadium before moving to the National Ice Centre. The budget for players was limited by the club chairman so that the Panthers would be able to break even the following season. Players were asked to take a wage cut, leading to the departure of Trevor Robins, Mike Bishop, Mark Kolesar, Eric Dubios and record goalscorer Paul Adey. This frustrated Mike Blaisdell who left the club in November to become head coach of the Sheffield Steelers. He was replaced by former coach Alex Dampier. Lacking the spending power of many of their rivals, Nottingham finished sixth in the eight team league. The club fared better in the Challenge Cup where it made the final for the second successive year but the team was defeated 2\\u20131 at London Arena by Mike Blaisdell's Steelers. On 22 March 2000 the Panthers hosted Newcastle in their final game at the Ice Stadium. Jamie Leach scored Nottingham's last goal at their home of 54 years but the club was defeated 2\\u20131 in overtime.\\n\\n Move to the National Ice Centre \\n\\nThe Panthers moved to the new National Ice Centre in September 2000 but endured a terrible first season in their new home. They were knocked out at the semi final stage of the Benson & Hedges Cup by the Steelers and suffered a dire first half to the regular season. By Christmas the team faced the prospect of not qualifying for the playoffs for the first time since 1985. Form improved during the second half of the season with the team winning five of their first seven home games during 2001, including a 6\\u20134 victory over the Sheffield Steelers marred by a violent bench clearing brawl. The Panthers still lay in ninth and last place going into their final game of the regular season, three points behind their opponents Newcastle Jesters. Nottingham required a regulation time win to claim the eighth and final playoff berth, something they had not done away from their home ice all season. The Jesters needed only to tie. With 10.1 seconds to go, the game was locked at 2\\u20132, but with an extra attacker the Panthers won a faceoff next to the Newcastle goal and Robert Nordmark scored with 4.4 seconds remaining to take them into the playoffs and eliminate the Jesters. In the playoffs a 5\\u20130 win over a financially troubled Sheffield Steelers was their only victory of the post season.\\n\\nthumb|right|250px|The National Ice Centre seen in 2001\\n\\nIn 2003 the Superleague collapsed after financial problems; it was left with only five members and faced the prospect of having only three. After uncertainty over which league the Panthers would be taking part in and even uncertainty over the future of the club itself, Nottingham became a founding member of the new Elite Ice Hockey League. Changes to the rules regarding the number of non-British trained players a club was allowed to sign saw the Panthers make substantial changes to their squad. After finishing second in the league, their highest finish in twelve years, Panthers qualified for the Challenge Cup final. Their opponent in the two-legged final was archrival Sheffield Steelers, a team that Nottingham had failed to beat in each of the six finals the two club's had contested. The first leg ended in a 1\\u20131 tie in Nottingham. In the second leg at Sheffield Arena the Panthers raced to an early 3\\u20131 aggregate lead. However, Sheffield pulled a goal back late in the second period and equalised with ten minutes remaining, forcing overtime.  After 53 seconds of the extra session Kim Ahlroos scored the winning goal, ending an eight-year wait for the Panthers to beat the Steelers in a showpiece final and securing the club's first silverware since 1998. The Panthers followed up their trophy win with a strong playoff campaign, but after a 6\\u20131 win over the Manchester Phoenix in the semi final, the Steelers avenged their Challenge Cup defeat with a narrow 2\\u20131 win in the final.\\n\\nthumb|left|250px|Nottingham and Cardiff line up prior to the 2007 playoff final\\n\\nThe 2004\\u201305 season saw the club take part in the Continental Cup. The Panthers were placed into a group with host team Gothiques d'Amiens, Italian side Milano Vipers and Slovenian side Olimpija Ljubljana. Nottingham tied their first game against Milan before recording 1\\u20130 and 3\\u20131 victories over the Slovenians and French, narrowly missing out on a place in the second round of the competition due to Milan's better goal difference. Domestically the team struggled for much of season and only during the end of season playoffs did the Panthers replicate the form they showed in Europe where, despite being depleted by injuries, they qualified for a second successive playoff final, losing 2\\u20131 in overtime to eventual Grand Slam winners Coventry Blaze.\\n\\nMike Blaisdell briefly returned to the club as coach for the 2005\\u201306 season, before being succeeded by Mike Ellis. Ellis made numerous changes to the playing staff and led the Panthers to a fifth place league finish. In the playoffs Nottingham eliminated the Sheffield Steelers and Belfast Giants before defeating the Cardiff Devils to clinch their first playoff title in 18 years. All three ties were decided on penalty shots with goaltender Rastislav Rovnianek saving all seven shots he faced during the course of the competition. The following season the Panthers won a second Challenge Cup title, defeating the Sheffield Steelers 9\\u20137 on aggregate in the final. This was the first time that the Panthers had won major honours in successive seasons.\\n\\n The Corey Neilson era \\n\\nCoach Mike Ellis departed the club following the 2007\\u201308 season, to be replaced by Corey Neilson. After a third-place finish in the 2008\\u201309 season, the Panthers mounted a title challenge during 2009\\u201310, remaining in contention for the championship until the final stages of the season. They eventually finished third for a third successive season. The Panthers also won the Challenge Cup for the second time in three seasons, defeating the Cardiff Devils 8\\u20137 on aggregate in the final. The 2010\\u201311 season started strongly, but the Panthers suffered a poor mid season run which scuppered their chances of winning the regular season title and led to players being fined a proportion of their wages. The team were able to rebound from this, first securing a 4\\u20133 aggregate victory over the Belfast Giants to successfully defend the Challenge Cup, then securing their third playoff championship with a 5\\u20134 win over the Cardiff Devils. The Panthers repeated the double in the 2011\\u201312 season first winning a third straight Challenge Cup with a 10\\u20134 aggregate victory over Belfast. In the playoffs, the Panthers defeated Braehead and Hull in the playoffs before winning 2\\u20130 against Cardiff in the final. The game was a tight affair, with David-Alexandre Beauregard breaking the deadlock after 53 goalless minutes.\\n\\nright|thumb|250px|The Panthers win the 2010 Challenge Cup, the first of nine titles won over the next 5 seasons.\\n\\nThe 2012 off-season began with the release of captain Danny Meyers and his replacement by fellow Great Britain international Jonathan Weaver. Other new additions included forwards David Ling, Patrick Galivan and Bruce Graham, while Jason Beckett and Eric Werner were brought in as new defencemen. The season began with the Panthers losing 2 of their first 4 home games. This prompted Neilson to re-sign defenceman Guillaume Lepine as well as Anthony Stewart, then of the Carolina Hurricanes, on a short-term deal due to the NHL lockout. Form began to improve and, following a shootout win in Cardiff on 8 December, Panthers went top of the league standings. They remained there for the rest of the season, clinching their first regular season title in 57 years on 15 March 2013. Patrick Galivan scored the championship-sealing goal late in the third period before Matt Francis added an empty-netter in a 5\\u20133 victory over the Belfast Giants. Five days later the Panthers defeated Sheffield 4\\u20131 in the first leg of the Challenge Cup final. This proved decisive, and a 2\\u20131 defeat in the second leg was not enough to deny the Panthers a fourth consecutive Challenge Cup title. Nottingham went on to face Belfast in the playoff final. The Panthers opened a 2\\u20130 lead before the Giants rallied to tie the game and force overtime. On the powerplay in the extra session, captain Jordan Fox scored to give Panthers the win and complete the Grand Slam.\\n\\nBy contrast, the 2013\\u201314 season was plagued by injuries, suspensions and a high turnover of players, and the Panthers fell to fourth in the final league table. They once again reached the Challenge Cup final, but were considered outsiders against a Belfast Giants team that comfortably won the league championship and finished 32 points ahead of Nottingham. The Panthers lost the first leg 5\\u20132, a result that left the Giants as strong favourites to lift the cup. However, the Panthers won the second leg 4\\u20131 to level the tie and force overtime. When that finished goalless, goaltender Craig Kowalski saved all three Belfast penalty shots and Petr Kalus scored to give Panthers a 7\\u20136 aggregate victory and a fifth consecutive Challenge Cup.\\n\\nAlthough a third playoff and Challenge Cup double followed in 2015\\u201316, the remainder of Neilson\\u2019s tenure was highlighted by the club\\u2019s performances in European competition. The club entered the Champions Hockey League in its inaugural season, and, although they were eliminated in the group stage, they did secure a 3\\u20131 victory over the Hamburg Freezers.  Two seasons later, the Panthers entered the 2016\\u201317 edition of the Continental Cup. After navigating their way through the first two rounds, the club participated in the final tournament in Ritten, where they won all three of their matches and became the first British team to win a major European tournament.  Their victory earned them a place in the 2017\\u201318 Champions Hockey League. Though they were seeded last in the competition, the Panthers produced a major upset by winning four of their six group matches, including a 4\\u20132 win over the fourth-seed SC Bern,  to qualify for the tournament\\u2019s knockout stage. They were eliminated in the round of sixteen with a 6\\u20131 aggregate defeat to the ZSC Lions.\\n\\n Name origins, logos and colours \\n\\nThe origin of the name Panthers is uncertain. One of the most widely known theories is that the club were named for a squadron of Canadian airmen based near Nottingham during World War II. However, there is no evidence to suggest that such a squadron existed and records indicate that the name was coined before these events could have taken place. A souvenir brochure produced to mark of the opening of the Ice Stadium in April 1939 stated that the venue's new team would be known as the Nottingham Panthers. It does not, however, explain the rationale behind the name.Nottingham Ice Rink Grand Opening Souvenir Brochure, 10 April 1939 Three games were played by teams using the name Nottingham Panthers during the winter of 1939\\u201340 before the name was revived in 1946.\\n\\nDuring the original era the Panthers did not have a logo, instead using stylised lettering on the front of their shirts. The club's current logo was adopted in 2003 and is the fifth to be used since the Panthers were reformed. The first was used between 1980 and 1994 and was the silhouette of a Panthers' head in a red circle. The second logo, adopted in 1994, was similar to the first but used a more detailed Panthers' head. The third logo, introduced in 1998, featured a keyhole shaped like the head of a cat with a Panther reaching through it. The fourth logo was adopted following the move to the National Ice Centre and was similar to the logo of German side Augsburger Panther. The stylised lettering used during the original era was used again on special shirts made to mark the sixtieth anniversary of the club in 2006.\\n\\nThe colours used by the original Panthers were black and white. Home shirts were black with a black and white striped lining on the shoulders. When the club reformed in 1980, the black and white colours were also revived, with a gold lining also being added to the jerseys. In 1996 red was added to the colour scheme of the shirts. In 2001\\u201302 the club's colour scheme was changed to black and gold. Home jerseys are gold with a black lining with away jerseys being the reverse. In 2007\\u201308, the Panthers brought out a predominantly white third jersey for the Challenge Cup.\\n\\n Stadiums \\n\\nThe original home of the Panthers was the Ice Stadium. Built by Sims, Sons and Cooke Ltd, the Ice Stadium was based on the Harringay Arena design and officially opened on 10 April 1939. The building hosted its first game two days later with the Harringay Greyhounds defeating the Harringay Racers 10\\u20136 in a challenge game in front of a crowd of  spectators. Though a team playing under the name Nottingham Panthers would play three games during the winter of 1939\\u201340, it would be 1946 before the venue would host a competitive match. During World War II the Ice Stadium served as a makeshift munitions store and morgue. The building reopened on 31 August 1946 and hosted another game between the Greyhounds and Racers before the Panthers made their competitive debut on 22 November, defeating the Wembley Monarchs 3\\u20132. The venue became the home of the team between 1946 and 1960 and again from the club's reformation in 1980 to 2000.\\n\\nleft|thumb|250px|Nottingham Ice Stadium\\n\\nThe Ice Stadium held a capacity of  spectators and had an ice pad measuring  by . After the club's reformation a second ice pad was installed in 1983. In October 1996 plans were announced by Nottingham City Council to replace the ageing building with a twin-rinked National Ice Centre. Work began on the  capacity arena section of the facility in the summer of 1998 and was completed in the spring of 2000. The Panthers played their final game at the Ice Stadium on 22 March 2000. After the game supporters were allowed to dismantle anything easily removable from the interior of the building to take home as souvenirs. The Ice Stadium was demolished soon afterwards to allow for the completion of the new Ice Centre.\\n\\nThe new National Ice Centre was designed by Nottingham City Council officials and was built by John Laing plc. The building cost \\u00a340 million to construct, of which \\u00a322.5 million was awarded by the National Lottery. The arena half of the facility was opened on 1 April 2000, with the second public skating pad opening a year later. Both rinks are Olympic sized ice pads measuring  by . The Panthers played their first game at their new home on 2 September 2000 when the team hosted the London Knights in the Benson & Hedges Cup. Barry Nieckar scored the club's first goal in a 2\\u20131 Panthers victory played to a crowd of .\\n\\n Honours\\n\\nNottingham\\u2019s first trophy was the English National League regular season title, which it won in 1950\\u201351. The first trophy of the modern era (beginning with the club\\u2019s reformation in 1980) was the Autumn Cup, won in 1986\\u201387. The original club won four major honours (3 regular season titles and 1 Autumn Cup) in 14 seasons, whereas the modern Panthers have secured 21 trophies in 39 seasons (1 Continental Cup, 1 regular season title, 6 playoff championships, 8 Challenge Cups and 5 Autumn Cups).\\n\\nDomestic\\n\\nLeague Championships\\n 1950\\u201351, 1953\\u201354, 1955\\u201356, 2012\\u201313\\n\\nPlayoff Championships\\n 1988\\u201389, 2006\\u201307, 2010\\u201311, 2011\\u201312, 2012\\u201313, 2015\\u201316\\n\\nAutumn Cups\\n 1955\\u201356, 1986\\u201387, 1991\\u201392, 1994\\u201395, 1996\\u201397, 1998\\u201399\\n\\nChallenge Cups\\n 2003\\u201304, 2007\\u201308, 2009\\u201310, 2010\\u201311, 2011\\u201312, 2012\\u201313, 2013\\u201314, 2015\\u201316\\n\\nEuropean\\n\\nIIHF Continental Cup\\n2016\\u201317\\n\\n Records and statistics \\nRandall Weber holds the record for Nottingham Panthers appearances, having played for the club 845 times between 1985 and 2002. Centre Chick Zamick comes second, having appeared 624 times between 1947 and 1958.\\n\\nCanadian forward Paul Adey is the club's all-time leader in goals, assists and points. He scored 828 goals and 781 assists for a total of  points in 609 appearance between 1988 and 1999. Zamick is in second place having scored 774 goals and 638 assists for 1412 points. He is the only other player to have amassed more than  points for the Panthers. Adey also holds the record for the most goals scored by a Panthers player in a single season with 120 during the 1994\\u201395 season. During the same season Rick Brebant set club records for the most assists and most points in a single season with 156 and 241 respectively.\\n\\nBritish forward Simon Hunt holds the club record for the most penalty minutes, serving  minutes in 524 appearances between 1988 and 1999. During 2000\\u201301 Barry Nieckar earned 352 penalty minutes, the highest number for a player in a single season.\\n\\nThe club's record win came on 31 October 1981 when the Panthers defeated the Southampton Vikings 31\\u20132 at the Ice Stadium. A few weeks earlier, on 4 October, the Panthers had recorded their record away victory with a 23\\u20131 win over the same opposition. The team's heaviest defeat came on 20 March 1988 with a 23\\u20131 away defeat at the Whitley Warriors. Nottingham's largest home defeat was a 14\\u20132 loss to the Dundee Rockets on 25 February 1984.\\n\\nThe Nottingham Panthers have held continuous membership of British ice hockey's highest division since the foundation of the Premier League in 1983 and are the only team to have this distinction.
